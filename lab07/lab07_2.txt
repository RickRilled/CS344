a) Categorical data can be label with words and terms, like color or style. Numerical is represented as some kind of number.

b) train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00005,
    steps=250,
    batch_size=3
)

This worked really well. At period 09, I got an RMSE value of 166.39

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00005,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="population"
)

This actually had better RMSE values before the 9th period. The best value was 175.92.


c)  The hyperparameters are as follows:
    learning_rate
    steps
    batch_size
    These values are largly data dependant, meaning no, there is no rule when trying to tweak the hyperparamters.
    It is dependant on your data.
