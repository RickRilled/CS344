 She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at 
 giggling hyenas and wails on it. The barker hands her a 
 stuffed animal as her prize. She hands it to the small KID 
 next to her and they continue walking.
 
 PATRICK 
 (sarcastic)
 A soft side? Who knew?
 
 KAT
 Yeah, well, don't let it get out
 
 PATRICK
 So what's your excuse?
 
 KAT
 Acting the way we do.
 
 PATRICK
 Yes
 
 KAT
 I don't like to do what people expect. 
 Then they expect it all the time and 
 they get disappointed when you change.
 
 PATRICK
 So if you disappoint them from the 
 start, you're covered?
 
 KAT
 Something like that
 
 PATRICK
 Then you screwed up
 
 KAT
 How?
 
 PATRICK
 You never disappointed me.
 
 She blushes under his gaze
 
 PATRICK 
 (continuing)
 You up for it?
 
 KAT
 For. . . ?
 
 He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins 
 SERIES OF SHOTS:
 
 The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, 
 stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
 
 Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
 Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
 
 Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of 
 her face.
 
 Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
 shots, they're both covered in paint
 
 She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
 empty.
 
 KAT 
 (continuing)
 Damn it!
 
 Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle. They land, 
 laughing.
 
 It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
 are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
 find each other's eyes.
 
 He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips, as he 
 goes to kiss her.
 
 NEARBY The kid with the stuffed animal, points
 
 KID 
 Look, Mom
 
 His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has 
 turned into a passionate kiss
 
 EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
 
 Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway. Their paint wardrobe 
 has dried by now and they look like refugees from some 
 strange, yet colorful, war.
 
 KAT
 State trooper?
 
 PATRICK
 Fallacy.
 
 KAT
 The duck?
 
 PATRICK
 Hearsay.
 
 KAT
 I know the porn career's a lie.
 
 He shuts off the car and turns to her.
 
 PATRICK
 Do you?
 
 He kisses her neck. It tickles. She laughs.
 
 KAT
 Tell me something true.
 
 PATRICK
 I hate peas.
 
 KAT
 No -- something real. Something no one 
 else knows.
 
 PATRICK 
 (in-between kisses)
 You're sweet. And sexy. And 
 completely hot for me.
 
 KAT
 What?
 
 PATRICK
 No one else knows
 
 KAT
 You're amazingly self-assured. Has 
 anyone ever told you that?
 
 PATRICK
 Go to the prom with me
 
 Kat's smile disappears.
 
 KAT
 Is that a request or a command?
 
 PATRICK
 You know what I mean
 
 KAT
 No.
 
 PATRICK
 No what?
 
 KAT
 No, I won't go with you
 
 PATRICK
 Why not?
 
 KAT
 Because I don't want to. It's a stupid 
 tradition.
 
 Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he 
 being paid to take her.
 
 PATRICK
 People won't expect you to go...
 
 Kat turns to him, getting angry.
 
 KAT
 Why are you doing this?
 
 KAT
 All of it -- what's in it for you?
 
 He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her 
 suspicions.
 
 KAT 
 (continuing)
 Create a little drama? Start a new 
 rumor? What?
 
 PATRICK
 So I have to have a motive to be with 
 you?
 
 KAT
 You tell me.
 
 PATRICK
 You need therapy. Has anyone ever told 
 you that?
 
 KAT 
 (quietly)
 Answer the question, Patrick
 
 PATRICK 
 (angry)
 Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. 
 Just the pleasure of your company.
 
 He takes out a cigarette. She breaks it in half before she 
 SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
 
 Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front 
 door and watches him go
 
 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
 
 Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
 
 He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who 
 has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
 
 Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey 
 gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
 
 PATRICK
 cover that up
 
 The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
 
 INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
 Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face 
 Bianca TAPS on the open door.
 
 BIANCA
 Quick question -- are you going to the 
 prom?
 
 Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM
 
 INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
 
 Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby. She 
 fingers a strand of her hair.
 
 BIANCA
 Then Guillermo says, "If you go any 
 lighter, you're gonna look like an extra 
 on 90210."
 
 CAMERON
 No...
 
 Bianca stares at him for a moment.
 
 BIANCA
 do you listen to this crap?
 
 CAMERON
 What crap?
 
 BIANCA
 Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm 
 like, boring myself.
 
 CAMERON
 Thank God! If I had to hear one more 
 story about your coiffure...
 
 He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and 
 smacks his hand away.
 
 CAMERON
 (continuing)
 I figured you'd get to the good stuff 
 eventually.
 
 BIANCA
 What good stuff?
 
 CAMERON
 The "real you".
 
 BIANCA
 Like my fear of wearing pastels?
 
 He looks stricken.
 
 BIANCA
 (continuing)
 I'm kidding. 
 (beat)
 You know how sometimes you just become 
 this "persona"? And you don't know how 
 to quit?
 
 CAMERON
 (matter of fact)
 No
 
 BIANCA
 Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how 
 to lie.
 
 INT. HALLWAY - DAY
 
 Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker. Finally, it 
 opens.
 
 Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th 
 Century. Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
 
 INSERT - "0 FAIR ONE. JOIN ME AT THE PROM. I WILL BE 
 WAITING. LOVE, WILLIAM S."
 
 Mandella's agog. Trevor walks by and sees her holding the 
 dress.
 
 TREVOR
 You're gonna look splendiferous in 
 that, Mandella.
 
 Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
 
 TREVOR 
 (continuing)
 that's cool to say.
 
 Mandella grins It is
 
 MANDELLA
 
 INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/DEN - DAY
 
 Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike
 
 SHARON
 Would you rather be ravished by a 
 pirate or a British rear admiral?
 
 WALTER
 Pirate -- no question.
 
 Bianca enters and walks over to Walter
 
 BIANCA
 Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with 
 you. It's tomorrow night --
 
 WALTER
 The prom? Kat has a date?
 
 BIANCA
 No, but
 
 WALTER
 It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s 
 who you want me to bend my rules for?
 
 BIANCA
 He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that 
 is.
 
 WALTER
 You're not going unless your sister 
 goes. End of story.
 
 BIANCA
 Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my 
 own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a 
 possession!
 
 Bianca storms out.
 
 WALTER
 (calling out)
 You know what happens at proms?
 
 Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
 
 SHARON
 They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll 
 come home. Let her go.
 
 WALTER
 Kissing? Is that what you think 
 happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up 
 to my elbows in placenta all day.
 
 INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
 
 Bianca lies on her bed. MTV blares. A KNOCK sounds.
 
 BIANCA
 Come in.
 
 Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.
 
 KAT 
 (kindly)
 Listen, I know you hate having to sit 
 home because I'm not Susie High School.
 
 BIANCA
 Like you care.
 
 KAT
 I do care. But I'm a firm believer in 
 doing something for your own reasons, 
 not someone else ' s .
 
 BIANCA
 I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only 
 sophomore that got asked to the prom and 
 I can't go, because you won ' t.
 
 Kat clears her throat
 
 KAT
 Joey never told you we went out, did 
 he?
 
 BIANCA
 What?
 
 KAT
 In 9th. For a month
 
 BIANCA
 (confused)
 Why?
 
 KAT 
 (self-mocking)
 He was, like, a total babe
 
 BIANCA
 But you hate Joey
 
 KAT
 Now I do. Back then, was a different 
 story.
 
 BIANCA
 As in...
 
 Kat takes a deep breath.
 
 KAT
 He said everyone was doing it. So I 
 did it.
 
 BIANCA
 You did what?
 
 KAT 
 (continuing on)
 Just once. Afterwards, I told him I 
 didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. 
 He got pissed. Then he broke up with 
 me.
 
 Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
 
 BIANCA
 But
 
 KAT
 After that, I swore I'd never do 
 anything just because "everyone else" 
 was doing it. And I haven't since. 
 Except for Bogey's party, and my 
 stunning gastro-intestinal display --
 
 BIANCA
 (stunned)
 Why didn't you tell me?
 
 KAT
 I wanted to let you make up your own 
 mind about him.
 
 BIANCA
 No. you didn't! If you really thought 
 I could make my own decisions, you 
 would've let me go out with him instead 
 of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
 
 Kat stands up slowly
 
 KAT
 That's not
 
 BIANCA
 I'm not stupid enough to repeat your 
 mistakes.
 
 KAT
 I guess I thought I was protecting you.
 
 BIANCA
 God, you're just like him! Just keep me 
 locked away in the dark, so I can't 
 experience anything for myself
 
 KAT
 Not all experiences are good, Bianca. 
 You can't always trust the people you 
 want to.
 
 BIANCA
 I guess I'll never know, will I?
 
 She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it 
 behind her.
 
 EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
 
 A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
 
 INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
 
 Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. She rolls over and 
 picks up the phone.
 
 BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
 
 Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while 
 watching "I Love Lucy" reruns.
 
 A KNOCK sounds
 
 BIANCA
 Come in.
 
 Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
 
 KAT
 Feel like shopping?
 
 Bianca looks up, hopefully.
 
 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
 Walter and Sharon are in front of the television. Walter 
 has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
 
 WALTER
 What do you wanna watch? We've got 
 crap, crap, crap or crap
 
 SHARON 
 Dr. Ruth?
 
 Bianca walks into the living room. She's wearing a prom 
 dress.
 
 BIANCA
 Hi, Mommy.
 (looking away)
 WALTER
 
 Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca 
 to Sharon.
 
 SHARON 
 Honey, you look beautiful!
 
 BIANCA
 You like? My date should be here in 
 five.
 
 WALTER
 I'm missing something.
 
 BIANCA
 I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a 
 captain of oppression like some men we 
 know.
 
 The DOORBELL RINGS. Bianca runs to open it. There stands 
 CAMERON. He takes in Bianca's outfit.
 
 CAMERON
 Wow
 
 BIANCA
 Let's go.
 
 Walter rises. Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
 
 SHARON 
 (to Bianca)
 Have a great time, honey!
 
 WALTER
 But -- who -- what --?

SCIPRT START

 LLOYD
 Excuse me, can you tell me how to
 get to the medical school? I'm
 supposed to be giving a lecture in
 twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
 lost.

 YOUNG WOMAN
 (heavy European accent)
 Go straight aheads and makes a left
 over za bridge.

Lloyd checks out her body.

 LLOYD
 I couldn't help noticing the accent.
 You from Jersey?

 YOUNG WOMAN
 (unimpressed)
 Austria.

 LLOYD
 Austria? You're kidding.
 (mock-Australian accent)
 Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
 we get together later and throw a
 few shrimp on the barbie.

The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 (to self)
 Guess I won't be going Down Under
 tonight...

He SIGHS and zips the window back up.

 2.

INT. LIMO

Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front
seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives
away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!

The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:

 DISPATCHER
 (v.o.)
 Carr 22, come in, car 22...

Lloyd grabs his CB mike.

 LLOYD
 This is 22.

 DISPATCHER
 22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
 You're running late on the East Side
 pick-up.

 LLOYD
 Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
 way.

 DISPATCHER
 (v.o.)
 Well hurry it up. And make sure you
 park legally. One more ticket and
 your ass is history.

 CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
This building is white with black spots on it, like a
DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.

HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of DOGS pile out.

 HARRY
 Okay, gang, single file. You know
 the rules: No pushing, no humping,
 and no sniffing heinies...

 3.

The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
PALMER, sticks his head out.

 PALMER
 Hey, why aren't those mutts on
 leashes?

 HARRY
 The same reason you're not on a leash,
 sir because it's demeaning and it
 chafes like hell.

 PALMER
 Just get them in here now! They all
 have to be bathed and clipped in an
 hour.

Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall.

 HARRY
 You kids stay right here...

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.

 HARRY (CONT'D)
 (at truck)
 Hey, wait a minute!

Harry chases after the vehicle.

 CUT TO:
EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY

Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL.

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.

 MARY
 Hello.
 (beat)
 I'll be just a minute...

 4.

As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...

 CUT TO:

INT. LIMO - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the
window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
is speechless. Then:

 LLOYD
 Why you going to the airport? Flying
 somewhere?

 MARY
 (dead-pan)
 How'd you guess?

 LLOYD
 Well, I saw your luggage, then when
 I noticed the airline ticket, I put
 two and two together.
 (beat)
 So where you heading?

 MARY
 Aspen.

 LLOYD
 Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear
 California's beautiful this time of
 year.
Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
glance.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.

 MARY
 I'm Mary.

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate
to impress her.

 LLOYD
 Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
 It's only temporary.

 5.

 MARY
 Oh?

 LLOYD
 Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
 are saving up our money so we can
 open our own pet store.

 MARY
 That's nice.

 LLOYD
 (smiling)
 I got worms.

 MARY
 I beg your pardon?

 LLOYD
 That's what we're gonna call it: I
 Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
 selling worm farms you know, like
 ant farms. A lot of people don't
 realize that worms make much better
 pets than ants. They're quiet,
 affectionate, they don't bite, and
 they're super with the kids.

 MARY
 Aren't ants quiet, too?

Lloyd realizes she has a point.

 LLOYD
 Uh... well, sure but they aren't half
 as affectionate. And if you cut an
 ant's head off, it won't grow back.

 MARY
 I see.

 LLOYD
 And best of all, worm farming is a
 seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
 industry. I wouldn't mind having a
 piece of that pie, if you know what
 I mean.

To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's
concerned about something.

 6.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 What's the matter? Little tense about
 the flight?

 MARY
 (beat)
 Something like that.

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.

 LLOYD
 It's really nothing to worry about,
 Mary. Statistically, they say you're
 more likely to get killed on the way
 to the airport. You know, like in a
 head-on crash, or something.

 MARY
 Um, Lloyd, could please keep your
 eyes on the road.

 LLOYD
 Good thinking. There's a lot of bad
 rivers out there.

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.

 CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.

 MARY
 Here you go.

 LLOYD
 Keep it. It was my pleasure.

For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
makes her more lovely than ever.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
 pass out. You'll be there before you
 know it.

 MARY
 Thanks Lloyd.
 (beat)
 And good luck with your worms.

 7.

Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.

Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo, LOVESICK. For a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to turn the key. He
just drops his head against the steering wheel, DEVASTATED.
There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there.

 POLICE OFFICER
 Come on, move it, you're in a red
 zone.

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.

 CUT TO:

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
focused straight ahead.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.

 ARMANI SUIT
 She's gonna leave the briefcase at
 the foot of the escalator. You make
 the pick-up.

 PLAID SPORTCOAT
 Piece of cake.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARY

WALKING ALONG.

When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
turns to see a car irectly behind him.

 LLOYD
 (to car's driver)
 Drive around me, you pinhead!

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.

 8.

He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL

The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP
THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at
each other, dumbstruck.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE

Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion
of numbers.

 LLOYD
 Damn!

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

HIS POV - his limo is being towed away under the supervision
of the Police Officer.

He takes off after it, but to no avail.
 LLOYD
 You can't do this! I'll lose my job!

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
fingers through his hair.

 CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.

 9.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE

MENTAL).

 MENTAL
 Who the hell do you figure this guy's
 working for?

 SHAY
 I don't know, but we'd better find
 out...

Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.

 SHAY (CONT'D)
 Your ulcer?

 MENTAL
 It ain't gonna kill me.

INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR

Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently
toward the door of their apartment.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Lloyd and Harry ENTER and pass each other quietly as they
both plunk down in their favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still
has the briefcase in his lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,
tweets hello, but the two guys just sit there SILENTLY.

The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The
carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a
miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt
and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.

 HARRY
 I got fired again.

Lloyd shakes his head.

 LLOYD
 I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but
 let's face it, you are one pathetic
 loser. No offense.

 HARRY
 None taken. Were you shitcanned,
 too?

 10.

 LLOYD
 Of course not.
 (beat)
 I quit.

 HARRY
 Why'd you quit?

 LLOYD
 I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire
 me.

 HARRY
 Why didn't you wait and see if your
 suspicions were well-founded?

 LLOYD
 Winners control their own destiny,
 Har.

Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one
to him.

 HARRY
 You know, the thing that really chaps
 my ass is that I just spent my life
 savings turning my van into a poodle.
 (beat)
 The alarm alone cost me two hundred.

 LLOYD
 Big deal. That car's an old bomb
 anyway.

 HARRY
 What are you talking about? It's
 only six years old.

 LLOYD
 That's forty-two in dog years.

They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry
notices the briefcase.

 HARRY
 What's with the briefcase?

 LLOYD
 It's a love memento.

 HARRY
 Huh?

 11.

 LLOYD
 The most beautiful woman alive. Her
 name was Mary. I drove her to the
 airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran
 high, breasts heaved. She left this
 case in the terminal and flew to
 Aspen and out of my life. End of
 story.

 HARRY
 What's in it?

 LLOYD
 DO you really expect me to go snooping
 around in someone else's private
 property?

 HARRY
 Why not?

 LLOYD
 (beat)
 It's locked.

They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a
LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK.
The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to
the

PEEPHOLE.

HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental
are standing at the door.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 (WHISPERING to Harry)
 Friend or foe?

 HARRY
 (WHISPERING)
 We don't have any friends.

Harry is still squinting out the peephole.

 HARRY (CONT'D)
 Can't recognize them. Could be student
 loan thugs again, or the IRS, or
 maybe somebody pissed off about that
 case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced
 a check on.

 12.

 LLOYD
 Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little
 swindlers gave me Peanut Butter
 Praline.

 HARRY
 Well, whoever they are, they look
 serious. One of them's even wearing
 plaid.

 LLOYD
 (cringing)
 That's a hostile pattern. I say we
 bail and get down to unemployment.

Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the
window and down the fire escape.

 CUT TO:

EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building
and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out.
Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE

HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY.

INT. STANLEY GRABNER'S OFFICE - UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE -
AFTERNOON

STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.

 GRABNER
 Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that
 neither I nor the unemployment
 epartment of the state of Rhose Island
 can do anything for you.
 (beat)
 You've run out of chances. You're
 unemployable. Remember last year?
 Middle of winter I busted my butt to

GET YOU BOTH PRIME JOBS. TWELVE-

fifty an hour, and you went and blew it!

 LLOYD
 Blew it? For your information, we
 only missed three days in two months.

 HARRY
 Yeah, and that was because of a
 blizzard

 13.

 GRABNER
 (exploding)
 YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS!

Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.

 HARRY
 Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find
 something else for us. How about
 another crack at that Suicide Hotline?

Grabner jumps up.

 GRABNER
 OUT!!!!!

INT. HARRY & LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

J.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen
cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom.

 MENTAL
 The briefcase ain't here. He must've
 taken it with him.

 J.P. SHAY
 Shit.
 (beat)
 Well he's gotta come home sometime.

Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage.

 MENTAL
 Maybe we should leave him a little
 message to let 'em know we're playing
 hardball.

Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around
the bird, who SCREECHES IN

TERROR.

 MENTAL (CONT'D)
 (a la Tweety Bird)
 I taut I taw a puddy cat.

Mental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone-
chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING.

 14.

 MENTAL (CONT'D)
 (still Tweety)
 I did, I did...

 DISSOLVE TO:

The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd
and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building
entrance.

 LLOYD
 Give me what's left of our dough.
 I'll go to the corner and buy a few
 necessities.

Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night
 Train?

 HARRY
 Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.

 CUT TO:

EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.
He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and
removes a quarter.

He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.
He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET
STILL INSIDE.

Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN
struggles by using a WALKER.

 LLOYD
 Excuse me, little old lady, do you
 have change for a dollar?

 ELDERLY WOMAN
 Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't...

 LLOYD
 Well could you do me a favor and
 guard this while I go break a dollar?
 My wallet's locked in this machine.

 15.

 ELDERLY LADY
 Of course, young man...

Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as
Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.
Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER,
AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he
sees that

SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO.

 CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT

A thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up
the steps to his apartment.

INT. LLOYD & HARRY'S APARTMENT

The door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the
couch, looking almost comatose.

 HARRY
 Where's the booze?

 LLOYD
 It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma
 Walton. She got my wallet, too.

Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Come on, man, cheer up. We've been
 own before. I'm sure we'll land on
 our heads somewhere.
 HARRY
 It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet
 Petey he's... he's dead.

Lloyd looks touched by this.

 LLOYD
 Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What
 happened?

 HARRY
 His head fell off.

 LLOYD
 His head fell off?

 16.

 HARRY
 Yeah, he was pretty old.

Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately.

 LLOYD
 (hopeful)
 I don't suppose he had a warranty...?

 HARRY
 Nah, I bought him used.

As Lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.

 LLOYD
 That's it! I've had it with this
 ump! We don't have food, we don't
 have jobs, our pets' heads are falling
 off, we're surrounded by roving gangs
 of larcenous old

LADIES...

 HARRY
 Okay, calm down.

 LLOYD
 No I won't calm down.

Lloyd flops down in a chair.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 What the hell are we doing here
 anyway, Harry? We've got to get out
 of this town.
 HARRY
 Yeah, and go where?

 LLOYD
 I'll tell you where: someplace warm,
 a place where the beer flows like
 wine, where beautiful women
 instinctively flock like the salmon
 of Capistrano.
 (dramatic PAUSE)
 I'm talking about Aspen.

 HARRY
 Aspen?

 LLOYD
 That's right, Aspen.

 17.

 HARRY
 I don't know, Lloyd, the French are
 assholes.

 LLOYD
 Let me ask you something: do you
 want to end up like Petey dead in
 some flea-ridden apartment, face-
 down on a Dear Abby column, with a
 soggy sunflower seed pressed against
 your beak? Or do you want to enjoy
 your life?
 (beat)
 Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's
 eath be in vain. Don't you see what
 he was saying? Spread your wings,
 man. he was saying? Spread your wings,
 man. Fly.

 HARRY
 (confused)
 What are you talking about, Lloyd?
 His head fell off.
 (dawning realization)
 Wait a second, I know what you're up
 to. You just wanna go to Aspen so
 you can find that girl who lost her
 briefcase and you need me to drive
 you there.

 LLOYD
 That's bullshit. I'll drive.
 (beat)
 And what's so wrong about going
 someplace where we know someone who
 can plug us into the social pipeline?
 HARRY
 (torn)
 I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should
 stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep
 saving money for the worm store. I'm
 getting a little sick and tired of
 always running from creditors.

Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry
cityscape.

 LLOYD
 You know what I'm sick and tired of,
 Harry? I'm sick and tired of having
 to eek my way through life. I'm sick
 and tired of being a nobody.
 (MORE)

 18.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 (beat)
 But most of all, I'm sick and tired
 of having nobody.

There's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then
Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.

 HARRY
 Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.

 LLOYD
 On the other hand, maybe you're right,
 Harry. Maybe we should stay here and
 try our luck in bankruptcy court.
 With all those lawsuits against us,
 I'm sure we'll win at least one. It
 could be a boost to our egos.

Harry sees that Lloyd has a point. He stands and approaches
Petey's cage. His eyes fill with tears.

 HARRY
 (emotional)
 Petey, I made a promise to you once,
 man...
 (thinking hard)
 ...and I'll be damned if I can remember
 what it was.

 CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny
Wilson's "Mary's Prayer" plays on the soundtrack. The van
drives past and we HOLD ON a sign that reads: "YOU ARE LEAVING

PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND. COME BACK SOON." VARIOUS OTHER
AERIAL

SHOTS of the car travelling down the road while the song
continues to play.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

Harry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat.
The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is BLASTING
on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG:

 19.

 LLOYD & HARRY
 "We've got to get out of this place,
 If it's the last thing we ever do,
 We've got to get out of this place,
 Girl, there's a better life, for me
 and you..."

Lloyd turns down the radio.

 LLOYD
 Well, we're finally doing it. Do you
 realize that in all the years we've
 known each other, this is the first
 time we've done this together.

 HARRY
 Been run out of town?

 LLOYD
 Taken a trip.

Harry reaches over and UNDOES HIS SEATBELT. Lloyd watches,
curious.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Why'd you do that?

 HARRY
 What?

 LLOYD
 Take your seatbelt off.

 HARRY
 Because we just cleared the danger
 zone.
 LLOYD
 Huh?

 HARRY
 Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety
 percent of all accidents happen within
 five miles of home. We've already
 traveled 6.3 miles.

LLOYD THINKS ABOUT THIS. THEN:

 LLOYD
 Well what about the people who live
 around here? What if we got into an
 accident with one of them?

 20.

Harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back
on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio.

 HARRY
 Where'd you get those?

 LLOYD
 Bought 'em when we filled up.

 HARRY
 Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer
 on all expenditures. We're on a tight
 budget, remember?

 LLOYD
 This didn't come out of our travel
 fund. I was able to scrape up twenty-
 five bucks before we left. You know,
 so we could live in style.

 HARRY
 Where'd you get twenty-five extra
 bucks?

 LLOYD
 I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.

 HARRY
 You mean the blind kid?

 LLOYD
 That's right.

Lloyd looks out the window guiltily.

 HARRY
 What did you sell him, Lloyd?

 LLOYD
 Just some odds and ends.

 HARRY
 Specifically?

 LLOYD
 Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of
 marbles, Petey, three comic books a
 second, are you telling me you sold
 my dead bird to a blind kid? Well
 who else was I gonna sell it to?

 HARRY
 But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a
 head.

 21.

 LLOYD
 Put your mind at ease, friend. I
 took care of it.

 CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a
little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing
with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the
ead bird up, but it flops into his lap.

 BILLY
 Fly!

Joe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps.

 CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A NOTE - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door.
It reads: TO ALL OUR

LOVED ONES - PACKED UP AND DROVE TO ASPEN - HAVE A NICE LIFE -

PULLBACK to reveal Joe Mental and J.P. Shay.

 MENTAL
 Those bastards. They're rubbing it
 right in our faces.

 J.P. SHAY
 Shit! Andre will have a goddamn
 aneurysm if we don't get that
 briefcase back.
 MENTAL
 Don't worry, we'll get it back. And
 I'll tell you something else. They
 ain't gonna reach Aspen, either.
 I'll make sure of that.

Mental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on
them.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops
more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs.
Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the
air.

 22.

 BILLY
 Come on, boy, fly!

Plop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS
OUT:

 BILLY (CONT'D)
 Excuse me, mister. Is there something
 wrong with my bird?

Mental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS
IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can.

 MENTAL
 Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew
 south for the winter.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON

Harry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out
before him.

 HARRY
 How far have we gone?

 LLOYD
 According to this map, about an inch
 and a half.

 HARRY
 Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map
 or we'll never get there. We don't
 have enough gas money.
 LLOYD
 Relax. We have more than enough.

 HARRY
 I believe you're wrong, Lloyd.

 LLOYD
 And I believe I'm right, Harry.

 HARRY
 I still say wrong, Lloyd.

 LLOYD
 How much you wanna bet?

 HARRY
 I don't bet.

 23.

Lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous.

 LLOYD
 What do you mean you don't bet?

 HARRY
 I mean I don't gamble, you know that.
 Never have and never will.

 LLOYD
 Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal
 that I can get you gambling before
 the day's out.

 HARRY
 There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do
 it.

 LLOYD
 I'll give you three-to-one odds.
 That's three feedbags if you win,
 against only one if you lose.

 HARRY
 You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I
 already told you, I don't gamble.

 LLOYD
 Okay, five-to-one I can get you
 gambling before the day's out.

 HARRY
 Sorry, pal, no way.

 LLOYD
 Make it ten-to-one.
Harry sticks out his hand.

 HARRY
 You got yourself a bet, sucker!

As Harry SHAKES LLOYD'S HAND, Lloyd breaks into a BIG SMILE.
Harry immediately realizes he's been had.

EXT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ - AFTERNOON

The Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor-
trailer trucks.

 24.

INT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables
of tough-looking TRUCKERS. Harry oesn't look happy. A middle-
aged, no-nonsense WAITRESS approaches their table with a
couple of burgers and drinks. She puts them down in front of
the boys and starts to walk away.

 LLOYD
 (to Waitress)

UH, EXCUSE ME...

The Waitress reluctantly returns to the table.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 What's the soup du jour?

 WAITRESS
 It's the soup-of-the-day.

 LLOYD
 Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.

 WAITRESS
 (sarcastic)
 Anything else before I leave the
 area?

 HARRY
 Actually, this chocolate milk isn't
 mixed very well. Could you please
 bring me a spoon?

The Waitress SIGHS and picks up the milk. Then she BLOWS
INTO THE STRAW, MIXING
THE DRINK.

 WAITRESS
 There. Now you don't need one.

The guys watch her stomp away.

LLOYD

FEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID-

back country-folk, don't it, Harry?

Harry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put
it in the ashtray, he accidentally

KNOCKS OVER THE SALT SHAKER.

 25.

 LLOYD
 Uh-oh...

 HARRY
 What's the matter?

 LLOYD
 You spilled the salt. That's bad
 luck. We're driving across the country
 and the last thing we need is bad
 luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt
 over your right shoulder.

 HARRY
 What for?

 LLOYD
 Because that's good luck.

Harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it
over his shoulder. Suddenly they hear a

YELP.

 MALE VOICE
 (o.s.)
 What the fuck?!

 LLOYD
 Or was it the left shoulder?

They turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his
eyes.

 TRUCKER
 Who's the dead man threw shit in my
 eye?

The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's
wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM,
SIXTY-NINE 'EM.

 HARRY
 It was a terrible accident, Sir.
 Believe me, I would never do anything
 to offend a man of your size. Please
 accept my most sincere apology.

The Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his
equally burly FRIENDS.

 BURLY FRIEND #1
 Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass!

 26.

Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger.

 SEA BASS
 You gonna eat that?

 HARRY
 Um... the thought had crossed my mind.

At this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF
TOBACCO SPIT ONTO

THE HAMBURGER.

 SEA BASS
 Still want it?

Harry stares at the burger non-commitally.

 HARRY
 Nah, you go ahead.

Sea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to
the LAUGHTER of his friends.

 HARRY
 Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I
 still haven't eaten.

 LLOYD
 Well if you'd stop picking fights
 with the locals...
 (brightening)
 Wait a second. I think I just had an
 idea. Follow me...

Lloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A
nervous Harry trails after him.

 27.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like
 to apologize for that unpleasant
 scene a little earlier.

 SEA BASS
 Huh?

 LLOYD
 What I'm trying to say is, my friend
 and I would like to buy you guys a
 round of beers, just to bury the
 hatchet.

Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the
Truckers seem to like the idea.

 SEA BASS
 Make it four boiler-makers.

 LLOYD
 Whatever you want, sir. I'll have
 the waitress send them over. Oh, and
 fellas hope to see you again down
 the road.

Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER.

 HARRY
 Lloyd, what are you doing? You know
 we can't afford to buy them drinks.

Lloyd hands the Cashier their check.

 LLOYD
 Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered
 to pick up our check. They said just
 add this to their tab.

 CASHIER
 (skeptical)
 Sea Bass said that?

 LLOYD
 Well, if that guy at the table over
 there is Sea Bass...

He points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass
NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING
TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced.

 CASHIER
 Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants...

 28.

Harry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy
bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter.

 HARRY
 Oh, and put these on there, too.

 CASHIER
 You got it.

 Island from here?

 Bass's face when he got the bill.

 HARRY
 I hope we never have to.

 LLOYD
 Don't worry. That fish-head is
 probably half-way to Providence by
 now.

 29.

 HARRY
 I hope so.

Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously.

 LLOYD
 Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a
 whiz.

 HARRY
 Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now.
 What if they figure out we went the
 other way. They'll be on us in no
 time.

 LLOYD
 But I gotta go. What am I supposed
 to do?

 HARRY
 Hold it.

 LLOYD
 I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.

 HARRY
 Well... just take a whiz in an empty
 beer bottle. There's a couple on the
 floor in the back seat.

 LLOYD
 Are you serious?

 HARRY
 Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping
 now. We could get killed.
Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back
seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND.
Then:

 LLOYD
 Uh-oh...

 HARRY
 What's the matter?

 LLOYD
 The bottle's almost full and I'm
 still going.

 HARRY
 Well stop going.

 LLOYD
 I can't stop once I already started,
 you know that. Quick, get me another
 bottle.

Harry can BARELY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL as he reaches way
in the back seat for an empty.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Jesus, be careful! You almost went
 off the road.

 HARRY
 I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best
 I can.

He hands Lloyd another empty and Lloyd quickly makes the
switch.

 LLOYD
 Here, hold this.

Before Harry knows it he's holding the full BOTTLE OF URINE.

Trooper takes off after them.

Harry is doing his best to steer while now holding FIVE FULL
BOTTLES AND Lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat.

 HARRY
 What are you, a goddamn camel?

 LLOYD
 Hey, I haven't gone all day.

Just then they hear a LOUDSPEAKER:

 STATE TROOPER

 Pull over!

They turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside
then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT:

 HARRY
 Huh?

 31.

 STATE TROOPER
 PULL OVER!

Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at
the Trooper.

 HARRY
 (calling out)
 No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for
 noticing!

He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled
Lloyd.

 police?

The Cop turns on his SIREN.

 STATE TROOPER

 Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty

 STATE TROOPER
 Uh-huh.

 Have you boys been doing a little
 rinking maybe?

 HARRY
 No, sir.

 STATE TROOPER
 Then what's that?

He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat
between them.

 HARRY
 Oh, that's nothing, sir.

 STATE TROOPER
 Do you know it's against the law to
 rive with an open alcohol container
 in this state?

 LLOYD
 But, your honor, he's telling the
 truth. It's not beer.

The officer smirks.

 STATE TROOPER
 Is that right?

The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He
inspects the beer label, then MOVES

THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.

 HARRY
 Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep
 your mouth shut if you knew what was
 good for you.

 LLOYD

YOU WOULD, TOO...

Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down
the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER
HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then:

LLOYD'S FANTASY:

Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered
chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue
and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out
of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary
opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks
into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she
slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow...

Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her,
she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances
over her shoulder at him.

CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY
BATHROOM. The shower is running and we see the silhouette of
two people behind the curtain.

 Nothing. Nothing at all.

than ever. As the CAMERA PANS DOWN toward her breasts, we
are surprised to see not breasts but a SET OF HEADLIGHTS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER CHEST AREA. The headlights FLASH ONCE.
Then TWICE.

Lloyd and Harry are sitting in a large, HEART-SHAPED JACUZZI.
Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer
as the water swirls around them.

 LLOYD
 Yep, this sure is the life. Cold
 beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink
 sheets... You know, there's only one
 thing that could make this moment
 any better.

 35.

 HARRY
 What's that?

 LLOYD
 If you had a nice set of knockers.

 HARRY
 That's two things, Lloyd.

 LLOYD
 Right now I'd settle for one.

Lloyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and
looks around at the romantic decor.

 HARRY
 I don't know, Lloyd, these places
 just don't do it for me. Brings back
 too many memories.

 LLOYD
 What happened, Harry? Some little
 filly break your heart?

 HARRY
 Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher.
 We stayed at a place like this once
 No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.

 LLOYD
 Felcher? You mean the babe who worked
 for the tractor company?

Harry nods.

 HARRY
 The same. We had this incredibly
 romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd
 be together forever.
 (SIGHS)
 Then about a week later, right out
 of the blue, she sends me a John
 Deere letter.

 LLOYD
 That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?

 HARRY
 I called her up and she gave me some
 crap about me not listening to her
 enough or something like that. I
 wasn't really paying attention.

Harry reaches for a beer and busts it open. He takes a big
gulp.

 Unlikely from what I've seen.

The ANXIOUS MAN taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental
to hang up.

 ANDRE
 I don't like this one goddamn bit,
 Mental. You and Shay were supposed
 to grab that bag so we could end
 this shit. Now I don't know what the
 hell's going on.

Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip.
The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again.

 37.

 MENTAL
 Hold on a second, Mr. Andre...

Mental puts the phone down and motions the Anxious Man closer
to the booth. The Man moves forward a few inches. Mental
motions him even closer. When he's about a foot away, Mental
punches his hand through the glass of the booth and knocks
the Anxious Man out cold. Then

Mental picks up the phone again.

 MENTAL (CONT'D)
 Sorry, boss. You were saying...?

 ANDRE
 Look, Mental, just find out what
 they're up to. I want to know who
 these guys are.

 MENTAL
 Don't worry. I'm on it.

Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's
not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van.
He's joined by J.P. Shay.

As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW
GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see
a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step
forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental
and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing.

 SHAY
 What the fuck...?

Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he
touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a
siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING.
Mental jumps back and pulls his gun.

 MENTAL
 Where's the goddamn dog?

Shay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now,
forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene.

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - ASPEN - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT of a luxurious mountainside home.

 38.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET

An agitated Mary Swanson (the young woman who lost her
briefcase) is pacing back and forth in

AN IMPRESSIVE, ANTIQUE-FILLED LIVING ROOM. SEATED ON A COUCH
ARE HER FATHER KARL AND HIS MUCH-

younger second wife, HELEN.

 MARY
 It just doesn't make any sense. I
 left the money exactly where they
 instructed me to.

 HELEN
 Actually, it makes a great deal of
 sense, Mary. We should have called
 in the authorities the moment we
 knew Melvin had been kidnapped.

 KARL
 Now, Helen, we've been through this
 already for Christ's sake, Karl,
 these bastards will extort us into
 bankruptcy if we let them.

 MARY
 But I'd never forgive myself if
 something happened to Melvin.

 KARL
 Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen.
 She's been through quite enough
 already.
 MARY
 It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all
 a little on edge.

Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed
Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn.

 ANDRE
 Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?

 KARL
 Nothing yet, Nicholas.

Andre looks upset.

 ANDRE
 Perhaps I should call off the
 Preservation benefit this weekend.

 39.

IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO RE-

schedule.

 HELEN
 No, Nicholas, it's imperative that
 we carry on as usual.

The atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl
Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter.

 KARL
 Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do
 everything they ask. Nothing's going
 to happen to Melvin, I promise you.

 MARY
 Thank you, Daddy.

Karl Swanson looks out the window, concerned.

 CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. Joe
Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. He takes
out his gun, SLIDES IN A NEW CLIP, and puts it back in his
pocket.

 MENTAL
 (to Shay)
 Lie down on the front seat. After
 they pick me up I want you to follow
 us.
Then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van
to come along.

 CUT TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

Lloyd taps Harry's shoulder.

 LLOYD
 You're it.

Harry taps Lloyd back.

 HARRY
 You're it.

Lloyd immediately taps Harry.

 40.

 LLOYD
 You're it. Quitsies.

 HARRY
 (tapping him back)
 Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies.
 No anti-quitsies. No startsies.

Lloyd shakes his head, defeated.

 LLOYD
 Damn, you're good, Harry.
 (beat)
 Hey, didn't I tell you this trip
 would be a blast?

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Joe Mental squints down the road, sees the Mutt Cutts van
approaching, and starts WAVING HIS HANDS to flag them down.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN

Through the windshield we can see Mental waving. The guys
don't slow down, through. The just WAVE BACK as they BLOW
RIGHT BY HIM. Harry also toots the horn, which makes the

SOUND OF A DOG BARKING.

 LLOYD
 See, I told you these country folks
 were friendly, Harry.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As an angry Mental watches them disappear down the road,
Shay sits up in the front seat.

 SHAY
 What happened?

 MENTAL
 These fuckers are really pissing me
 off now.

 CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER THAT DAY

We hear The Zombie's 'Time of the Season' as the van flashes
by.

 41.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

 HARRY
 Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd:
 what exactly do we do when we get to
 Aspen?

 LLOYD
 Well the first thing we do is take a
 good deep breath of that famous
 Aspenese air.

 HARRY
 Fresh, huh?

 LLOYD
 The freshest. They say on any day of
 the week you can smell a moose-fart
 ten miles away.

 HARRY
 (sincere)
 Wow... talk about paradise.
 (beat)
 And after we're finished breathing,
 what next, Lloyd?

 LLOYD
 Then we make a splash on the social
 scene.

Just then, Lloyd notices something up the road.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Harry, look the golden arches. Pull
 over, I'm starving.
 CUT TO:

EXT. MCDONALD'S - DAY

The Mutt Cutt car is at the drive-through window.

 MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
 ...That's two cheese burgers, two fries,
 and two medium Cokes. Five seventy-
 two.

Harry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the Employee, who returns a
handful of change.

 HARRY
 Thanks.

 42.

Then, before he can give them the bag of food, the guys
absentmindedly DRIVE OFF. As they pull out of the parking
lot, the McDonald's Employee sticks his head out the window
and WAVES THE BAG OF FOOD at them.

 MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
 Hey!

But the guys are already around the corner.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Mutt Cutt van is on the road again, cruising along.

INT. MUTT CUTT VAN - DAY

 HARRY
 About this social scene how do you
 expect a couple mutts like us to
 make a splash in the land of pedigrees
 when we don't even have any money?

 LLOYD
 Look, once we drop the briefcase off
 to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll
 plug us right into the party circuit.
 After that, we do a little of the
 ski

SCENE, HOB-NOB WITH THE ELBOW-

rubbers, and walk out of there in the spring with enough
business connections to open a first-class worm operation.
You see, you don't get rich working, Harry. You get rich
knowing the rich.
 HARRY
 Where'd you hear that?

 LLOYD
 Some bum down at unemployment.

Harry thinks about this.

 HARRY
 I don't know, Lloyd.

 LLOYD
 What's the matter?

 HARRY
 Money does terrible things to people.
 I mean, we could lose our friendship.

 43.

Lloyd thinks about this.

 LLOYD
 Yeah? So?

Harry nods and looks out the window. Suddenly SOMETHING DAWNS
ON LLOYD.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Hey, wait a second. Hold everything.

 HARRY
 What?

 LLOYD
 Aren't you forgetting something?

Harry thinks about this.

 LLOYD (CONT'D)
 Back at Mickey D's? A little matter
 you might've overlooked...?

Harry wracks his brain, but to no avail.

 HARRY
 What?

Lloyd rolls his eyes.

 LLOYD
 My change.

As a sheepish Harry gives Lloyd his change, they notice
something up ahead.
HARRY & LLOYD'S POV - ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, JOE MENTAL IS
WAVING THEM

DOWN AGAIN. This time the Cadillac is PARKED SIDEWAYS ACROSS
THE ROAD,

BLOCKING THEIR PATH.

 HARRY
 I think this guy's in trouble. Why
 on't you pull over.

Lloyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He
pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the
passenger window.

 44.

 MENTAL
 You guys going as far as Des Moines?
 My car died and I'm late for a
 business meeting.

 CUT TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

They're back on the highway and Joe Mental is SITTING BETWEEN
THEM, looking extremely ANNOYED. The guys are in the middle
of an argument.

 HARRY
 It's a fruit.

 LLOYD
 It's a vegetable.

 HARRY
 I'm telling you, it's a fruit.

 LLOYD
 And I happen to know it's a vegetable.

 HARRY
 Tell you what, why don't we leet an
 impartial judge decide.

 LLOYD
 Fine with me.

Harry turns to Joe Mental.

 HARRY
 Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet:
 Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?

Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his
mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF
STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though,
Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of
hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS.

 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER

The trio have picked up SIX MIGRANT WORKERS and everyone is
crammed into the car including a CRYING BABY who sits on a
pissed-off Mental's lap. Someone's playing a FLAMENCO GUITAR
and the gang is SINGING a SPANISH SONG.

SCRIPT END

SCRIPT START

BOY
No, he just says you're full of crap and that's
why you went out of business.

He kicks Stantz in the leg. Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.

STANTZ
 (low and menacing)
I'm watching you.
 (to Winston)
Song.

Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the
Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing

STANTZ AND WINSTON
'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.
Who you gonna call?'

KIDS
 (all together)
He-Man!!

 CUT TO:

EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.

WINSTON
That's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties.
I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
nine-year-olds.

STANTZ
Come on, Winston. We can't quit now. The
holidays are coming up. It's our best season.

They get in the car

INT. ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

WINSTON
Give it up, Ray. You're living in the past.
Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year
these kids won't even remember who we are.

STANTZ
 (tries to start the car again)
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we
did for this city.

WINSTON
Yeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job
we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
man and blew the top three floors off an uptown
highrise.

STANTZ
Yeah, but what a ride. You can't make a
hamburger without chopping up a cow.

He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement. Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies. Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

 CUT TO:

INT. WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)

A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman." There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.

VENKMAN

He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.

VENKMAN
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
Anglund.
 (to his guest)
Milt, your new book is called The End of the
World. Isn't that kind of like writing about
gum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you
think anybody wants to read a book about it?

MILTON
Well, I think it's important for people to know
that the world is in danger.

VENKMAN
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to
happen or do we have to buy the book?

MILTON
I predict that the world will end at the
stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

VENKMAN
This year? That's cutting it a little close,
isn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of
view, the book just came out, right? So you're
not even looking at the paperback release for
maybe a year. And it's going to be at least
another year after that if the thing has
movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
You would have been better off predicting 1992
or even '94 just to be safe.

MILTON
 (irritated)
This is not just some money-making scheme! I
didn't just make up the date. I have a strong
psychic belief that the world will end on New
Year's Eve.

VENKMAN
 (placating)
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But
I think my other guest may disagree with you.
Elaine, you had another date in mind?

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.

ELAINE
According to my sources, the world will end
on February 14, in the year 2016.

VENKMAN
Valentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer.
Where did you get that date, Elaine?

ELAINE
I received this information from an alien. I
was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
a drink in the bar when he approached me and
started talking. Then he must have used some
sort of ray or a mind control device because
he made me follow him to his room and that's
where he told me about the end of the world.

VENKMAN
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

ELAINE
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I
can't be sure, Peter.

VENKMAN
 (humoring her)
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole
problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
You may get some nice ones occasionally like
Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
be some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just
about out of time.
 (does his wrap-up right TO
 the CAMERA)
Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
pets.
 (holds up a hairless cat)
Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
 (puts a finger to his temple
 and sends out a though to his
 viewers)
... Good night.

 CUT TO:

INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)

Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.

VENKMAN
Where do you find these people? I thought
we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
the spoons?

NORMAN
A lot of the better psychics won't come on the
show. They think you're too skeptical.

VENKMAN
Skeptical! Norman, I'm a pushover. I think
professional wrestling is real.

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.

VENKMAN
 (to Norman)
What's all this?

NORMAN
They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'

VENKMAN
The Mayor! He's a friend of mine.

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.

VENKMAN
 (calling to the Mayor)
Lenny!

The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.

VENKMAN
 (starts to follow him)
Lenny! It's Pete Venkman!

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.

HARDEMEYER
 (snide)
Can I help you?

VENKMAN
 (dangerous)
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.

HARDEMEYER
I'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant.
What can I do for you?

VENKMAN
I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just
want to say hello to him.

HARDEMEYER
 (scornful)
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman. Busting
any ghosts lately?

VENKMAN
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
about. We did a little job for the city a
while back and we ended up getting sued,
screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

HARDEMEYER
 (bristling)
Look, you stay away from the mayor. Next fall,
barring a disaster, he's going to be elected
governor of this state and the last thing we
need is for him to be associated with two-bit
frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
friends. You read me?

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.

VENKMAN
Okay, I get it. But I want you to tell Lenny
that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.

 CUT TO:

EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors. Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)

We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence. Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling. Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy. Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.

DANA

She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy. Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.

JANOSZ
 (with an East European accent)
Still working on the Turner?

Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.

DANA
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
Janosz.

JANOSZ
You know, you are really doing very good work
here. I think soon you may be ready to assist
me in some of the more important restorations.

DANA
Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here,
but now that my baby's a little older, I was
hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

VIGO PAINTING

At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.

JANOSZ AND DANA

Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.

JANOSZ
 (disappointed)
We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I
could take you to lunch today?

DANA
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have
an appointment.
 (looks at her watch)
In fact, I'd better go.

She starts gathering up her things.

JANOSZ
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got
something else to do. Do I have bad breath
or something?

DANA
 (trying to brush him off)
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.

JANOSZ
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.

JANOSZ
 (to himself)
I think she likes me.

He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.

 CUT TO:

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building. A sign
identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."

INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)

Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.

DANA
... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
dead in the middle of the street

SPENGLER

Did anyone else see this happen?

DANA
Hundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't
imagine this.

SPENGLER
I'm not saying you did. In science we always
look for the simplest explanation.

An ASSISTANT interrupts.

ASSISTANT
We're ready, Dr. Spengler

SPENGLER
 (to the Assistant)
We'll start with the negative calibration.

He picks up the device and prepares to test it.

DANA
 (curious)
What are you working on, Egon?

SPENGLER
I'm trying to determine whether human
emotional states have a measurable effect on
the psychomagnetheric energy field. It's a
theory Ray and I were working on when we had
to dissolve Ghostbusters.

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room. Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.

SPENGLER
 (to Dana)
They think they're here for marriage
counseling. We've kept them waiting for two
hours and we've been gradually increasing the
temperature in the room.
 (checking a heat sensor)
It's up to 95 degrees at the moment. Now my
assistant is going to enter and ask them if
they'd mind waiting another half-hour.

As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay. They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass. After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.

SPENGLER
We'll do the happiness index next.
 (to Dana)
I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
it's all right with you.

DANA
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

SPENGLER
Oh no.

DANA
 (affectedly casual)
Do you ever see him?

SPENGLER
Occasionally

DANA
How is he these days?

SPENGLER
Venkman? I think he was borderline for a
while there. Then he crossed the border.

DANA
Does he ever mention me?

SPENGLER
No. Not that I can recall.

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.

DANA
 (slightly disappointed)
Well, we didn't part on very good terms and
we sort of lost track of each other when I
got married.

The Assistant interrupts again.

ASSISTANT
We're ready for the affection test.

SPENGLER
 (to the assistant)
Good. Send in the puppy.

DANA
 (continuing)
I thought of calling him after my marriage
ended, but --. Anyway, I appreciate you're
doing this, Egon

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl. Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.

DANA
 (handing him a card)
This is my address and telephone number.
Will you call me?

SPENGLER
Certainly.

DANA
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
this to Peter if you don't mind.

SPENGLER
I won't.

DANA
Thank you.

She shakes his hand and exits.

SPENGLER
 (to his assistant)
Now let's see how she reacts when we take
away the puppy

 CUT TO:

EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)

It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village. The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore. The TELEPHONE RINGS.

STANTZ
 (v.o., answering the phone)
Ray's Occult.

INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS

The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt. He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe. As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.

STANTZ
 (on the phone)
Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What
have I got? I've got alchemy, astrology,
apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon
intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic
surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie
sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've
got it all -- what are you looking for? ...
Don't have any. Try the stockyards.

He hangs up.

SPENGLER
Who was that?

STANTZ
Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come
up with anything?

SPENGLER
 (referring to the book)
This one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a
flower cart took off by itself and rolled
approximately half a kilometer over level
ground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.

STANTZ
You might want to check those Duke University
mean averaging studies on controlled
psychokinesis.

SPENGLER
 (going to the stacks)
Good idea.

The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.

VENKMAN
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm
looking for an aerosol love potion I could
spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would
make her unconditionally submit to an unusual
personal request.

STANTZ
Oh, hiya, Pete.

VENKMAN
So, no goat hooves, huh?

STANTZ
 (strung)
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's
up? How's it going?

VENKMAN
Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and
buy me a sub?

STANTZ
 (slightly evasive)
Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.

Spengler steps out of the stacks.

VENKMAN
Egon!

SPENGLER
Hello, Venkman.

VENKMAN
How've you been? How's teaching? I bet
those science chicks really dig that big
cranium of yours, huh?

SPENGLER
I think they're more interested in my
epididymis.

VENKMAN
I don't even want to know where that is.

Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.

STANTZ
Oh, your book came in, Venkman. Magical
Paths to Fortune and Power.

He hands Venkman the book.

VENKMAN
Great.
 (reading the contents)
So what are you guys working on?

STANTZ
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.

VENKMAN
Who?

STANTZ
 (at a loss)
Who? Just -- someone we know.

VENKMAN
Oh, Ray --

He grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up.

VENKMAN
Who? Who? Who?

STANTZ
Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!

VENKMAN
Who, Ray?

STANTZ
 (giving in)
Dana! Dana Barrett!

Venkman lets go of his ears and smiles. Spengler looks at Stantz and
shakes his head.

 CUT TO:

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)

The apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of
modern and traditional pieces. Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does
day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL
RINGS.

 CUT TO:

Dana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door. She opens
it and admits Ray and Egon.

DANA
 (hugging Ray)
Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for
coming.

STANTZ
No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.

DANA
 (to Spengler)
Hi, Egon.

She shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears
in the doorway.

VENKMAN
Hi, Dana.

Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.

VENKMAN
I knew you'd come crawling back to me.

She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his
presumptuousness.

DANA
Hello, Peter.

VENKMAN
 (to Dana)
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you
didn't call me first. I'm still into all
this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen
my show?

DANA
I have. That's why I didn't call you first.

VENKMAN
I can see that you're still very bitter about
us, but in the interest of science, I'm going
to give it my best shot. Let's go to work,
boys.

Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on
the baby and the immediate physical environment.

VENKMAN AND DANA

Venkman starts nosing around the apartment. Dana follows him.

VENKMAN
So what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he
ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.

DANA
He didn't "ditch" me. We had some problems,
he got a good offer from an orchestra in
England and he took it.

VENKMAN
He ditched you. You should've married me,
you know.

DANA
You never asked me, and every time I brought
it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

VENKMAN
Men are very sensitive, you know. We need to
feel loved and desired, too.

DANA
Well, when you started introducing me as "the
old ball and chain," that's when I left.

VENKMAN
I may have a few personal problems but one thing
I am is a total professional.

He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.

SPENGLER

He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby
with a tape measure and calipers.

VENKMAN
What are you going to do, Egon? Knit him a
snowsuit?

Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.

SPENGLER
I'd like to have a stool specimen

VENKMAN
Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or
professional reasons?

VENKMAN
 (picking up the baby)
Okay, kid. Up you go.

He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing
his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.

VENKMAN
Help! Please somebody help me! Get him off!
Quickly! He's gone completely berserk!

Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.

DANA
What do you think?

VENKMAN
There's no doubt about it. He's got his
father's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely
ugly. And smelly.
 (resumes playing with the baby)
You stink! It's just horrible. You are the
stinkiest baby I ever smelled.
 (to Dana)
What's his name?

DANA
His name is Oscar.

VENKMAN
Oscar! You poor kid!

DANA
 (losing patience)
Peter, this is serious. I need to know if you
think there's anything unusual about him.

VENKMAN
Unusual?
 (holds up the baby and
 scrutinizes him)
I don't know. I haven't had a lot of
experience with babies.

He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper
off.

DANA
 (taking the specimen jar)
I'll do it.

VENKMAN
I'll supervise.

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NURSERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman enters and finds Stantz monitoring the room.

VENKMAN
 (to Stantz)
Well, Holmes, what do you think?

STANTZ
It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything
was going on it's totally subdued now.

Spengler enters.

VENKMAN
 (to Spengler)
What now, Brainiac?

SPENGLER
I think we should see if we can find
anything abnormal on the street.

VENKMAN
Finding something abnormal on the street
shouldn't be too hard.

 CUT TO:

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the
runaway buggy. Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from
the pavement and the buildings.

VENKMAN
 (to Dana, nostalgic)
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't
it?
 (pointing out familiar
 neighborhood sights)
There's our old cash machine. And the dry
cleaners we used to go to. And the old
video store.
 (he wipes away an imaginary
 tear)
We really had some good times, didn't we?

DANA
We definitely had a moment or two.

Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.

DANA
That's where the buggy stopped.

VENKMAN
Okay, let's take a look.

Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill. Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.

STANTZ
 (reading the PKE meter)
Is this the spot?

DANA
A little to the left. Right there! That's
where it stopped.

Stantz reads the PKE meter.

STANTZ
Nothing. Not a trace.

SPENGLER
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

VENKMAN
What's that?

STANTZ
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
giga electron volts.

SPENGLER
That's a thousand million electron volts.

VENKMAN
I knew that.

Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.

STANTZ
I think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's
something brewing under the street.

DANA
 (worried, to Venkman)
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic
problem or something that makes me vulnerable
to these supernatural things.

VENKMAN
You mean like the time you got possessed and
turned into a monster terror dog? No, not
a chance. Total coincidence.
 (to Stantz and Spengler)
Am I right?

Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the
coincidence theory.

 CUT TO:

INT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATE AFTERNOON

The museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and
employees are leaving.

INT. RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME

Janosz is working late on the painting of Vigo.

VIGO PAINTING

Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow.

JANOSZ

He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red,
crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body,
driving him to his knees.

PAINTING

The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures
dramatically at him. Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice.

VIGO
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the
sorrow of Moldavia, command you.

JANOSZ
 (in agony)
Command me, lord.

VIGO
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain,
I sat on a throne of blood. What was will
be, what is will be no more. Now is the
season of evil. Find me a child that I might
live again.

Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes.
He screams and falls to his knees.

 CUT TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT

Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee,
sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street.

VENKMAN
I love this. We're onto something really
big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to
make some headlines with this one.

STANTZ
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts?
If anybody found out about this we'd be in
serious trouble. The judge couldn't have
been clearer - no ghostbusting.

VENKMAN
Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing
nice and quiet, low key, no profile.

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the
street. Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is
lit by strong work lights.

POLICE CAR

It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops. The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.

FIRST COP
How ya doing?

SPENGLER
 (reeking with guilt)
Fine! It's cutting fine now.

FIRST COP
 (curious)
Why are you cutting?

SPENGLER
 (looking for one of the
 others)
Why are we cutting? Uh - boss!

Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.

FIRST COP
What are you doing here?

VENKMAN
 (belligerent)
What the hell's it look like we're doing?
We're bustin out asses over here 'cause
some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
better to do than make idiots like us work
late on a Friday night, right?
 (looks to Spengler for
 agreement)

SPENGLER
 (with a "right on" fist)
Yo.

The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.

FIRST COP
Okay, boys, take it easy.

They drive off. Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.

SPENGLER
You were supposed to help me with this.

VENKMAN
You need the exercise.

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole. Suddenly he hits metal. They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.

STANTZ
 (examing it)
NYPRR. What the hell -- ? Help me lift
this.

They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.

STANTZ
 (shining a flashlight into
 the hole)
Wow! It's an old airshaft. It just goes
forever.

Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.

SPENGLER
Very intense. We need a deeper reading.
Somebody has to go down there.

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.

STANTZ
Thanks, boys.

They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch. Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.

STANTZ (O.S.)
 (his voice echoing in the
 airshaft)
Keep going -- more -- more --

INT. HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent
in total darkness.

STANTZ
 (using a radio now)
Lower -- lower --
 (to himself)
Gee, this really is deep.

Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.

STANTZ
 (shouts)
Hold it! Steady!

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into
the tunnel below.

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT

He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled
Art Nouveau mosaics. A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION.

STANTZ

He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.

STANTZ
 (reverently)
This is it, boys, the end of the line. Van
Horne Station. The old New York Pneumatic.
It's still here.

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.

SPENGLER
 (explaining)
The New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an
experimental subway system. Fan-forced
air-trains, built around 1870.

STANTZ
 (over the walkie-talkie)
This is about as deep as you can go under
Manhattan without digging your own hole.

SPENGLER
 (to Stantz)
What's the reading?

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely
high reading.

STANTZ
 (on the radio)
Off the top of the scale. This place is
really hot. Lower me to the floor.

As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight
down the wall of the station, then onto the floor.

STANTZ
 (shouts)
Hold it!! Stop!! Whoa!!

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze.

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in
the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING
through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,
and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain
-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad
and eerie symphony.

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT

STANTZ
 (ranting on the radio)
Oh, my God! It's a seething, bubbling,
psychic cess! Interlocked tubes of plasm,
crackling with negative GEVs! It's glowing
and moving! It's -- it's a river of slime!!

STANTZ

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he
can. He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting
the pole.

SLIME

Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet. He jerks his legs up
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

STANTZ
 (on the radio)
Haul me up, Venkman! Now!

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's
car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier. A
burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two
cops.

SUPERVISOR
 (no nonsense)
Okay, what's the story here?

Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex
hardhat.

VENKMAN
What, I got time for this? We got three
thousand phones out in the Village and about
eight million miles of cable to check.

SUPERVISOR
 (not buying it)
The phone lines are over there.
 (points to the curb)

Venkman pops Spengler on the head.

VENKMAN
I told ya!

Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.

STANTZ (O.S.)
 (filtered)
Help! Help! Pull me up! It's alive! It's
eating my boots.

Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.

FIRST COP
You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.
We checked. Tell me another one.

Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.

VENKMAN
Gas leak?

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME

Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which
is now bubbling up the shaft after him.

STANTZ
 (shouting)
Get me out of here!!

Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old,
rusting conduit.

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping
through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT

One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks
out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.

STANTZ (O.S.)
Sorry.

INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over
the living room. Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for
information about the blackout. She listens to a special news report
for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door
and looks in. Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz
standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of
the hallway. He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.

DANA
 (surprised)
Janosz?

JANOSZ
Hello, Dana. I happened to be in the
neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to
see if everything's all right with you --
you know, with the blackout and everything?
Are you okay? Is the baby all right?

His affected concern is chilling. She is frightened but conceals it
from him.

DANA
 (mechanically and cautiously)
We're fine, Janosz.

He tires to look around her into the apartment.

JANOSZ
Do you need anything? You want me to come
in?

DANA
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks
anyway.

JANOSZ
Okay, just thought I'd check. Good night,
Dana. Sleep well. Don't let the bedbugs
bite you.

DANA
Good night, Janosz.

She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there
staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.

INT. HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like
headlights and he walks off down the hall.

 CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY

The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the
court to order.

JUDGE
I want to make one thing very clear before
we go any further. The law does not recognize
the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe
in them either, so I don't want to hear a
lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and
demons. We're going to stick to the facts
in this case and save the ghost stories for
the kiddies. Understood?

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.

STANTZ
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?

SPENGLER
His nickname is "The Hammer."

Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,
CPA and former demonic possession victim. Louis is desperately paging
through a mountain of legal textbooks.

LOUIS
 (nervous)
I think you're making a big mistake here,
fellas. I do mostly tax law and some probate
stuff occasionally. I got my law degree at
night school.

STANTZ
That's all right. We got arrested at night.

SPECTATORS' GALLERY

Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.

DANA
I wish I could stay. I feel personally
responsible for you being here.

VENKMAN
You are personally responsible. If I can
get conjugal rights, will you visit me at
Sing Sing?

DANA
Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.

VENKMAN
Don't worry about me. I'm like a cat.

DANA
You mean you cough up hairballs all over
the rug?

VENKMAN
I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.

DANA
 (sincerely)
Good luck.

VENKMAN
Thanks.

She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits. Venkman savors it for
a moment then goes back to the defense table.

PROSECUTION TABLE

Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the PROSECUTOR,
a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties.

HARDEMEYER
How are you doing, hon? Just put these guys
away fast and make sure they go away for a
long, long time.

PROSECUTOR
It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges.

HARDEMEYER
Good. Very good. The mayor and future
governor won't forget this.

He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table
on his way out of the courtroom.

DEFENSE TABLE

The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches.

HARDEMEYER
 (gloating)
Nice going, Venkman. Violating a judicial
restraining order, willful destruction of
public property, fraud, malicious mischief
-- smooth move. See you in a couple years
-- at your first parole hearing.

Herdemeyer exits. Louis looks devastated.

LOUIS
Gee, the whole city's against us. I think
I'm going to be sick.

Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first
witness.

INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - DAY (LATER)

The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying.

PROSECUTOR
Mr. Fianella, please look at Exhibits A
through F on the table over there. Do you
recognize that equipment?

EXHIBIT TABLE

Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three
proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various
meters and detection devices.

CON ED
 (o.c.)
That's the stuff the cops found in their
truck.

WITNESS STAND

She continues.

PROSECUTOR
Do you know what this equipment is used for?

CON ED
 (shrugs)
I don't know. Catching ghosts, I guess.

PROSECUTOR
 (to the Judge)
May I remind the court that the defendants
are under a judicial restraining order that
specifically forbids them from performing
services as paranormal investigators and
eliminators.

JUDGE
So noted.

PROSECUTOR
Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the
substance in the jar on the table marked
Exhibit F?

PROSECUTOR

She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the
slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel.

CON ED
I been working underground for Con Ed for
27 years and I never saw anything like that
in my life. We checked out that tunnel the
next day and we didn't find nothing. If it
was down there, they must have put it there.

DEFENSE TABLE

Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.

STANTZ
 (defensively)
Hey, I didn't imagine it. There must have
been ten thousand gallons of it down there.

SPENGLER
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal
source.

LOUIS
 (nervously)
Should I say that?

SPENGLER
I doubt that they'd believe us.

Louis moans and goes back to his notes.

 WIPE TO:

INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER

Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.

LOUIS
So like you were just trying to help out
your old friend because she was scared and
you didn't really mean to do anything bad
and you really love the city and won't ever
do anything like this again, right?

PROSECUTOR
Objection, your Honor. He's leading the
witness.

JUDGE
The witness is leading him. Sustained.

LOUIS
Okay, let me rephrase that question.
 (to venkman)
Didn't you once coach a basketball team for
underprivileged children?

VENKMAN
Yes, I did. We were city champs.

PROSECUTOR
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.

JUDGE
Sustained. Mr. Tully, do you have anything
to ask this witness that may have some
bearing on this case?

LOUIS
 (to Venkman)
Do I?

VENKMAN
No, I think you've helped them enough already.

LOUIS
 (to the Judge)
No, I guess not.
 (to the Prosecutor)
Your witness.

The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.

PROSECUTOR
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court
why it is you and your co-defendants took it
upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
middle of the street.

VENKMAN
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many
holes already we didn't think anyone would
notice.

The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.

JUDGE
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in
contempt.

VENKMAN
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets
me up like that I can't resist.

PROSECUTOR
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman. Why were
you digging the hole? And please remember
that you're under oath.

VENKMAN
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me
in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
There are things in this world that go way
beyond human understanding, things that
can't be explained and that most people don't
want to know about anyway. That's where we
come in.

PROSECUTOR
So what are you saying? That the world of
the supernatural is your special province?

VENKMAN
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens
and somebody has to deal with it.

The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.

 WIPE TO:

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

The trial is nearing its end. The Judge calls on Louis to make his
summation.

JUDGE
Does the counsel for the defense wish to
make any final arguements?

Louis rises.

LOUIS
Your honor, may I approach the bench?

JUDGE
 (impatient)
Yes.

Louis crosses to the judge's bench.

LOUIS
 (to the judge)
Can I have some of your water?

JUDGE
Get on with it, counselor!

LOUIS
 (scared)
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --
 (he remembers there's no
 jury)
audience. I don't think it's fair to call
my clients frauds. Okay, the blackout was
a big problem for everybody. I was stuck in
an elevator for about three hours and I had
to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I
don't blame them because once I turned into
a dog and they helped me. Thank you.

He goes back to the defense table and sits down. Stantz and Spengler
hang their heads. Venkman pats Louis on the back.

SPENGLER
 (to Louis)
Way to go. Concise and to the point.

JUDGE

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.

JUDGE
That's it? That's all you have to say?

LOUIS
Did I forget something?

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.

JUDGE
That was unquestionably the worst
presentation of a case I've ever heard in a
court of law! I ought to cite you for
contempt and have you disbarred. As for
your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz
and Egon Spengler, on the charges of
conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction
of public property, I find you guilty on all
counts. I order you to pay fines in the
amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to
eighteen months in the city correctional
facility at Ryker's Island.

STANTZ

He sees the activity in the jar

STANTZ
Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.

THE BENCH

The Judge continues

JUDGE
And on a more personal note, let me go on
record as saying that there is no place in
decent society for fakes, charlatans and
tricksters like you who prey on the
gullibility of innocent people. You're
beneath the contempt of this court. And
believe me, if my hands were not tied by the
unalterable fetters of the law, a law which
has become in my view far too permissive and
inadequate in it's standards of punishment,
I would invoke the tradition of our
illustrious forebearers, reach back to a
sterner, purer justice and have you burned
at the stake!

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily. Then
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.

SPECIMEN JAR

The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz anticipates big trouble.

STANTZ
Under the table, boys!

The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.

LOUIS

He stands up and looks around fearfully.

INT. COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases. All eyes turn to the
exhibit table. Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.

JUDGE

He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and
recognizes them immediately.

JUDGE
 (in horror)
Oh, my God! The Scoleri Brothers!

SCOLERI BROTHERS

Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten
feet tall. They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still
attached. Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to
get at the Judge.

JUDGE

Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the
spectral intruders.

JUDGE
 (terrified)
You've got to do something!

VENKMAN
Who are they?

JUDGE
They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them
for murder. They were electrocuted up at
Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me.

VENKMAN
Maybe they just want to appeal.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.

PROSECUTOR

She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge
with them.

VENKMAN
These boys aren't playing around.

JUDGE
 (desperately)
You've got to stop them. Please!

LOUIS
 (thinking like a lawyer)
Violating a judicial restraining order could
expose my clients to serious criminal
penalties. As their attorney I'd have to
advise them against it.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They start punching through the jury box.

JUDGE

He is just about hysterical with fear.

JUDGE
All right! All right! I'm recinding the
order. Case dismissed!!
 (he pounds his gavel on
 the floor)
Now do something!

STANTZ
Let's go to work, boys.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were
being displayed as evidence. They strap them on hastily as the Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

VENKMAN
 (slinging the pack onto
 his back)
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

STANTZ
 (grabbing other gear)
Okay, let's heat 'em up!

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers.

STANTZ
All right, throwers. Set for full neutronas
on stream.

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them.

VENKMAN
Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own
size?

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot
lightning at their new adversaries.

STANTZ
 (to the others)
On my signal, boys. Open 'em up -- Now!

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.

VENKMAN
Spengs, take the door. Ray, let's try and
work them down and into the corner.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on
the floor.

STANTZ
Watch it! I'm coming under you, Pete.

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers. Finally, Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of
light energy.

STANTZ
Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him
down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the
traps which snap shut.

INT. COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY

LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a
ghost inside each trap.

VENKMAN
 (checking the trap)
Occupado.

INT. COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE)

He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and
looks around in total amazement.

LOUIS

He crawls out from under a chair. Reporters and spectators get back on
their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.

PROSECUTOR

She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.

SPENGLER
 (to the Prosecutor)
Brilliant summation.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of
them standing in the wrecked courtroom.

VENKMAN
Case closed, boys. We're back in business.

The spectators cheer and applaud.

 CUT TO:

EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance. It's just like the original "No
Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding
up two fingers. Venkman enters the firehouse.

INT. BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT

A man and his wife are lying in bed reading. The man is played by Louis
Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,
is playing his wife. They are both terrible actors. Suddenly, a ghost,
actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom. Janine
sees it and screams.

LOUIS
What is it, honey?

JANINE
It's that darn ghost again! I don't know
what to do anymore. He just won't leave us
alone. I guess we'll just have to move.

LOUIS
Don't worry. We're not moving. He is.

He picks up the phone.

JANINE
Who are you going to call?

LOUIS
 (with a wink)
Ghostbusters.

As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters
standing in the bedroom. Their acting isn't much better than Louis and
Janine's.

GHOSTBUSTERS

Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.

STANTZ
I'm Ray --

VENKMAN
I'm Peter --

SPENGLER
I'm Egon --

STANTZ
And we're the ...

ALL
 (together)
Ghostbusters.

STANTZ
That's right -- Ghostbusters. We're back
and we're better than ever with twice the
know-how and twice the particle-power to
deal with all your supernatural elimination
needs.

During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the
fake ghost.

STANTZ
Careful, Winston. He's a mean one.
 (TO CAMERA)
And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're
giving you twice the value with our special
half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.

VENKMAN
Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone
crazy?

STANTZ
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.
Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,
waiting for his cue.

SPENGLER
You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage
thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids?

He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon.

STANTZ
You bet.

As Stantz wraps it up, SUPERS APPEAR at the bottom of the SCREEN: FULLY
BONDED - FULLY LICENSED - SE HABLA ESPANOL.

STANTZ
 (TO CAMERA)
So don't wait another minute. Make your
supernatural problem our supernatural problem.
Call now, because we're still --

ALL
 (in unison, mechanically)
-- Ready to believe you.

 CUT TO:

INT. JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY

Hardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office.
He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV.

 CUT TO:

EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER)

The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out
onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING. Louis comes
running out after it.

 CUT TO:

INT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor.
He sniffs around, following the smell.

LOUIS
Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really
big --

He freezes.

INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV

Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing
down Louis's bag lunch. Slimer looks up and sees Louis.

SLIMER AND LOUIS

They both scream and run off in opposite directions.

SLIMER

He passes right through a wall and disappears.

LOUIS

He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry.

LOUIS
 (screaming)
Help! There's a thing!

 CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)

Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog
along the track that circles the reservoir. One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.

GHOSTLY JOGGER

A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace. Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them. Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME)

Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.

STANTZ

He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging
track.

GHOST JOGGER

He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting. As the
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit
concealed control buttons. A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.

VENKMAN
 (checking his watch)
You know he ran that last lap in under six
minutes?

STANTZ
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic
prospect.

 CUT TO:

EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap
dime-store Santa Claus hats.

STANTZ
 (to the client)
Merry Christmas!

 CUT TO:

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - ORREFORS GLASS STORE - DAY

The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the
Ghostbusters enter the store.

INT. ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the
glass shelves and display tables. Stantz and Venkman are talking to the
manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices
positioned in each corner of the store.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which
throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store. The manager
watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,
SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.
There is a long pregnant pause.

STANTZ
 (to the manager)
So will that be cash or a check?

 CUT TO:

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Everyone else has gone home. Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting
her supplies away.

VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting. As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement. Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

INT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area. We PAN
DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a
ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk. Hanging from strings over the desk
are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.

WALL

Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the
chicken bait. He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to
the chicken.

LOUIS

His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.

LOUIS
 (shouts)
Gotcha!

DESK

The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy. Slimer
dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down
on Louis's desk.

LOUIS
 (seeing the damage)
Uh-oh.

He slinks off, defeated.

 CUT TO:

INT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY

The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security
desk. Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a
giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE. Venkman enters.

VENKMAN
I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

SECURITY GUARD
Room 304 -- Restorations.
 (recognizing him)
Hey! Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.'
I'm a big, big fan. That used to be one of
my two favorite shows.

VENKMAN
 (flattered)
Thanks. What's the other one?

SECURITY GUARD
'Bass Masters.' It's a fishing show. Ever
see it?

VENKMAN
Yeah, really great. Take it easy.

He exits.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer. Janosz is
at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo.
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.

VENKMAN
 (looking at the Ver Meer)
So this is what you do, huh?

DANA
 (glad to see him)
Oh, hello, Peter.

VENKMAN
You're really good, you know.

DANA
I didn't paint it. I'm just cleaning it.
It's an original Ver Meer. It's worth about
ten million dollars.

VIGO

He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.

VENKMAN

Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,
holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.

VENKMAN
You know you can go to Art World and get
these huge sofa-size paintings for about
forty-five bucks.

He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.

DANA
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk
about art.

VENKMAN
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell
you that I haven't forgotten your problem
and that we're still on the case.

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.

JANOSZ
 (smiling at Venkman)
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to
your friend?

DANA
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman.
Peter, Janosz Poha.

Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.

JANOSZ
 (avoiding his gaze)
Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on
television.

VENKMAN
How are you?
 (looking over at the Vigo
 painting)
What's that you're working on, Johnny?

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go. Venkman and Dana cross to
the Vigo painting. Janosz steps protectively in front of it.

JANOSZ
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new
Byzantine exhibition. It's a self-portrait
of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled
most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
Century.

VENKMAN
 (staring at the painting)
Too bad for the Moldavians.

JANOSZ
 (defensive)

He was a very powerful magician. A genius
in many ways and quite a skilled painter.

DANA
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
I hate this painting. I've felt very
uncomfortable since they brought it up from
storage.

VENKMAN
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want
to hang in the rec room. You know what it
needs?
 (picking up a brush)
A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.

JANOSZ
 (with forced good will)
We don't go around altering valuable
paintings, Dr. Venkman.

VENKMAN
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if
I were you.

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.

VENKMAN
 (to Janosz)
I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting
you.

JANOSZ
My pleasure.

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.

VENKMAN
 (confidentially)
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a
little crush on this guy.

DANA
Good-bye, Peter.

VENKMAN
 (dragging his feet)
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have
time to hang around here. I'll call you.
 (calls out to Janosz)
Later, Johnny!

He exits.

VIGO

Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting. As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement. Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

 CUT TO:

INT. FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab
area.

STANTZ
Oh good, you're here. Spengler and I have
something really amazing to show you.

VENKMAN
 (to Spengler)
It's not that thing you do with your
nostrils, is it?

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container.

STANTZ
 (to Venkman)
We've been studying the stuff that we took
from the subway tunnel.

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.

VENKMAN
And now you're going to eat it?

STANTZ
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish.

STANTZ
Now watch this.

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.

STANTZ
 (simulating anger)
You worthless piece of slime!!
 (as the slime starts to
 twitch and glow)
You ignorant disgusting blob!!

SPECIMEN

It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.

STANTZ
You foul, obnoxious muck!!

STANTZ

He continues venting his rage on the slime.

STANTZ
I've seen some real crud in my time, but
you're a chemical disgrace!!

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish.

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They turn to Venkman for his reaction. He's dumbfounded.

VENKMAN
This is what you do with your spare time?

STANTZ
 (very excited)
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.
A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this
is, it clearly responds to human emotional
states.

VENKMAN
'Mood slime.' We ought to bottle this stuff
and sell it.

SPENGLER
We've found it at every event site we've
been to lately.

WINSTON
 (poking at the slime)
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad
vibes'?

STANTZ
Like a goat on garbage.

STANTZ
We're running tests to see if we can get an
equally strong positive reaction.

VENKMAN
What kind of tests?

STANTZ
 (a little embarrassed)
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say
supportive, nurturing things --

VENKMAN
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

Spengler reacts as if he might be.

STANTZ
It really responds to music.
 (to Spengler)
Let's calm it down.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to
the slime specimen.

SPECIMEN

It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.

WINSTON
Does it have any favorites?

STANTZ
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'
'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small
World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

STANTZ
Watch this.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER"
BLASTS from the speakers.

TOASTER

It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.

VENKMAN

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

VENKMAN
I don't care what you say. This could be a
major Christmas gift item.

WINSTON
Right, and the first time someone gets mad,
their toaster will eat their hand.

VENKMAN
So we'll put a warning on the label.

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving. Venkman looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.

VENKMAN
 (to the toaster)
Go ahead. I dare you.

Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and won't let go. The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and
easily withdraws his hand.

VENKMAN
Just kidding.

 CUT TO:

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet. She's
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby. She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

DANA
 (talking sweetly to the
 baby)
Look at you. I think we got more food on
your shirt than we got in your mouth.

BATHTUB

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub. Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub. When she turns away, both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

DANA

Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub.

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the
bubble bath.

DANA
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth. Dana screams, snatches the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

 CUT TO:

INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment. Venkman is asleep on the
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed
just short of the bedroom. The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to
his feet and answers it. He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,
wrapped in a baby blanket.

DANA
 (somewhat embarrassed to
 be there)
I'm sorry. Were you on your way out?

VENKMAN
 (surprised to see her)
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
Come on in.
 (noting her apparel)
Are we having a pajama party?

DANA
 (upset)
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

Venkman looks at her for a long moment.

VENKMAN
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd
have serious doubts. But coming from you,
I can't honestly say I'm surprised.

DANA
I must be losing my mind. At the museum
today I could have sworn that terrible
painting of Vigo looked right at me.

VENKMAN
Who could blame him? Were you wearing this
nightgown?

DANA
 (distraught)
I don't know what to do anymore.

VENKMAN
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the
bathtub. You better stay here.

He exits to the bathroom. She looks around the loft, amazed at the
disorder. Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her.

VENKMAN
Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts
tying it around him like a diaper.

VENKMAN
 (to the baby)
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.
You could get a lot of chicks with this.
Just don't pee in it.

DANA
Peter, what about the bathtub?

VENKMAN
 (grabs the phone and dials)
We'll take care of that.
 (on the phone)
Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right
away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
tried to eat the kid.

DANA
It was full of this awful pink ooze.

VENKMAN
 (to Ray)
Sounds like another slime job ... No,
they're all right. They're here now ...
Right ... Let me know.

He hangs up.

VENKMAN
They're going over there right now. You
might as well make yourself at home. Let
me show you around.
 (he crosses to the kitchen area)
This is the cuisine de maison --

It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash. He grabs a big open
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.

VENKMAN
 (looking at the sink)
We may have to wash some of these if you get
hungry --
 (he looks in the fridge)
-- but there's no food anyway so forget
about it. I have all kinds of carry-out
menus if you feel like ordering.

He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then
crosses to the bathroom.

VENKMAN
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy
up a few things.

DANA
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have
to do any of this, you know.

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING
and more items going into the Hefty bag.

VENKMAN (O.S.)
The shower works but it's a little tricky.
They're both marked "Hot." It takes a little
practice, but at least this one won't try
and eat you.

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder.

VENKMAN
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.
But the bed's good and I just changed the
sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In
fact, I think you should definitely plan on
spending the night here.

DANA
Really? And how would we handle the sleeping
arrangements?

VENKMAN
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and
you spoon up right behind me with your arms
around me. If we go the other way I'm
afraid your hair will be getting in my face
all night.

DANA
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with
the baby.

VENKMAN
Or we could do that.

DANA
Thank you.
 (she picks up Oscar)
Poor baby. I think I should put him down
now.

VENKMAN
I'll put him down for you.
 (taking the baby)
You are way too short! And your belly-button
sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to
your poor mother!

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.

 CUT TO:

EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.

VENKMAN
Did you find anything at Dana's?

STANTZ
Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in
and around the bathtub. But we did turn up
some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
you mentioned. I found the name Vigo the
Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
Martyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:

SPENGLER
 (reads from xerox of entry)
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

VENKMAN
A hundred and five years? He really hung
on, didn't he.

STANTZ
And he didn't die of old age either. He was
poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
disemboweled, drawn and quartered.

WINSTON
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end
there.

SPENGLER
No, not exactly a man of the people.
 (reads)
"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
Unholy."

STANTZ
This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in
all the Black Arts, and listen to this
prophecy. Just before his head died, his
last words were, "Death is but a door, time
is but a window. I'll be back."

VENKMAN
That's it? "I'll be back?"

SPENGLER
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.

INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.

RUDY
Hey, Dr. Venkman. What's going on?

VENKMAN
We're just going up to Restorations for a
minute.

RUDY
Oh, I can't let you do that. Mr. Poha told
me not to let you up there anymore.

VENKMAN
 (with mock seriousness)
Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but
I think you can be trusted. Tell him, Ray.

STANTZ
 (very official)
Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,
subfusionary flux in this building.

RUDY
We got a flux?

WINSTON
You got a flux and a half.

STANTZ
Now if you don't want to be the --
 (he counts)
-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
from a planar rift, I suggest you get down
behind that desk and don't move until we
give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters
head upstairs.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter. He
rushes over and stops them at the door.

JANOSZ
Dr. Venkman? Dana is not here.

VENKMAN
I know.

JANOSZ
Then why have you come?

VENKMAN
We got a major creep alert and we're just
going down the list. Your name was first.

STANTZ
 (to Spengler and Winston)
Let's sweep it, boys.

They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.

VENKMAN
 (to Janosz)
You know, I never got to ask you. Where you
from, Johnny?

JANOSZ
 (nervous)
The Upper West Side.

SPENGLER
 (consulting his PKE meter)
This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.

JANOSZ
What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?

VENKMAN
We'll know when we find it. You just sit
tight. This won't take long.

STANTZ

Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio. Venkman
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.

VENKMAN
This is the one that looked at Dana.

JANOSZ
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.
People start imagining things --

VENKMAN
 (interrupts)
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing
theory. If she says it looked at her, it
looked at her.
 (to Vigo)
Hey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking
to you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking
to you.

They watch the painting for any sign of movement.

VIGO

His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.

VENKMAN
 (to Vigo)
Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby.
Just have fun with it.
 (to Stantz)
Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish
up and get out of here.

STANTZ
I'll get one more reading.

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting. Stantz scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.

VIGO

His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.

STANTZ

He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle
transformation occurs within him. Winston comes up behind him and breaks
the spell.

WINSTON
 (looking at the painting)
Now that's one ugly dude.

STANTZ
 (coming back to his senses)
Huh? What?

WINSTON
You finished here?

STANTZ
 (distracted)
What? Yeah.

WINSTON
Are you all right? You coming down with
something?

STANTZ
No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for
a second there. Let's go.

They head for the door.

JANOSZ

He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.

JANOSZ
So you see, everything is in order, is it
not?

VENKMAN
Not. Don't leave town and report any change
in your address to the proper authorities.
We'll be back.

They exit.

 CUT TO:

EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.

SPENGLER
There's definitely something going on in
that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus
and the Giga-meter was showing all red.

WINSTON
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

VENKMAN
Yeah, that's a safe bet.
 (to Stantz)
You and Spengman see what else you can dig
up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.
Those two were made for each other.

INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse. Stantz is at the
wheel. His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense. Stantz
swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.

STANTZ
 (to another driver)
Idiot!
 (honking)
Move it, you jerk!

Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.

EXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously
through traffic.

INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Winston looks at Ray, concerned.

WINSTON
Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?

Stantz turns on him.

STANTZ
 (viciously)
Are you telling me how to drive?

WINSTON
No, I just thought --

STANTZ
Well don't think!

He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.

EXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue. Pedestrians leap to safety as
Stantz runs a red light.

INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.

WINSTON
 (to Stantz, really worried
 now)
Are you crazy, man? You're going to kill
somebody!

Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.

STANTZ
No, I'm going to kill everybody!

He swerves off the road.

EXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car heads right for a big tree.

INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel
and steps across to stomp on the brakes.

EXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car skids into the tree and stops. The Ghostbusters stumble out
dazed and shaken, but unhurt. Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the
others, completely at a loss.

STANTZ
 (himself again)
What happened?

VENKMAN
You just picked up three penalty points on
your driver's license.

WINSTON
Are you all right?

STANTZ
Yeah, I guess so. It was the strangest
thing. I knew what I was doing but I
couldn't stop. This really terrible feeling
came over me and -- I don't know -- I just
felt like driving into that tree and ending
it all. Whew! Sorry, boys.

They inspect the damage to the car.

VENKMAN
 (confidentially, to
 Spengler)
Watch him, Egon. Don't even let him shave.

 CUT TO:

INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)

There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman
enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small
suitcase of Dana's.

VENKMAN
 (calls out)
I'm home!

He looks around the large open loft.

VENKMAN
 (to himself)
I knew it. She cleaned.

He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom. The door is
half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through
the transparent vinyl curtain. He closes the bathroom door and looks at
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling
off. Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel. She jumps back into the bathroom.

She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.

VENKMAN
Are you all squeaky clean now?

DANA
 (humoring him)
Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything
at my apartment?

She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.

VENKMAN
 (through the door)
Nothing. They stayed there all night, went
through your personal stuff, made a bunch of
long-distance phone calls and cleaned out
your refrigerator. And didn't find anything.

Dana opens the bedroom door.

DANA
They didn't find anything? In the bathtub
... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do
I do now?

VENKMAN
Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a
babysitter and everything. Trust me, you
need it.

DANA
I'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar
in a strange place with someone I don't know.

VENKMAN
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's
one of my most valuable employees.

DANA
Does she know anything about babies?

VENKMAN
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?
 (handing her the flowers)
Do I have a vase? I brought some of your
clothes. Wear something intriguing. I
brought along some interesting possibilities.

DANA
Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.

She smiles and closes the door again. He opens the closet and starts
looking for his good suit.

VENKMAN
Did you happen to see some shirts on the
floor in here?

DANA (O.S.)
I put them in your hamper. I thought they
were dirty.

VENKMAN
 (shaking his head)
I have a hamper? Next time ask me first,
okay. I have more than two grades of
laundry. There're lots of subtle levels
between clean and dirty.

He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.

VENKMAN
These aren't so bad yet. You just hang them
up for a while and they're fine.

 CUT TO:
INT. FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING

Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs. She starts
primping and freshening up her makeup.

INT. FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME

Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once
and for all. He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.

LOUIS
 (to himself)
Okay, Stinky, this is it. Showdown time.
You and me, pal. You think you're smarter
than I am? We'll see about that.
 (loud)
Oh, hello, Pizza Man! Oh, two larges! I
only ordered one. Oh, pepperoni and
pineapple. My absolute favorite. I guess
I'll have to eat these both by myself.

THE CEILING

Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging
upside down.

LOUIS

He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.

LOUIS
 (quietly)
Okay, let's boogie!

He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a
gash across the ceiling.

THE STAIRS

Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and
strikes the wall behind her. Slimer disappears.

LOUIS
 (embarrassed and apologetic)
Oh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do
that. It was an accident.

JANINE
What are you doing up here?

LOUIS
I was trying to get that smelly green thing.
The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the
fifth Ghostbuster.

JANINE
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if
you're already an accountant?

LOUIS
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls
in sick or gets hurt.

Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.

JANINE
Have you made any plans yet? You know
tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

LOUIS
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my
corporate tax year which is March first.
That way I beat the crowds.

JANINE
That's very practical. I hate going out on
New Year's Eve, too.

There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.

JANINE
Well, good night, Louis.
SCRIPT ENDS

SCRIPT STARTS

NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 He's still breathing.

 SWAN

 Where did he come from?

 GIBBS
 Mary mother of God ...

Attention is turned away from the boy --

The sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship litters
the water... along with the bodies of its crew. What is
left of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flag
hanging limply from the stern.

The H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all. The
scene calls for hushed voices.

 SWAN
 What happened here?

 NORRINGTON
 An explosion in the powder magazine.
 Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

 GIBBS
 Lot of good it did them...
 (off Swan's look)
 Everyone's thinking it! I'm just
 saying it! Pirates!

 SWAN
 There is no proof of that. It could
 have been an accident. Captain, these
 men were protection. If there is even
 the slightest chance one of those poor
 devils is still alive, we cannot
 abandon them!

 NORRINGTON
 Of course not, Governor.
 (to the crew)
 Come about and strike the sails! Unlash
 the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off
 the cannons!
 (to Swann)
 Hope for the best...prepare for
 the worst.
 (to two sailors)
 Move the boy aft. We'll need the
 deck clear.

They lift the boy. Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the
rail, away from the hideous scene in the water.

 SWAN
 Elizabeth, I want you to accompany
 the boy. He's in your charge now.
 You'll watch over him?

Elizabeth nods gravely. Swann hurries away to help unstow
the longboat. The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop
deck, behind the wheel, then hurry off. Elizabeth kneels
down besides the boy.

His good looks are not lost on her. She reaches out,
gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --

Suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. Elizabeth is
startled, but their eyes lock. She takes his hand in hers.

 ELIZABETH
 My name is Elizabeth Swann.

 WILL
 Will Turner.

 ELIZABETH
 I'm watching over you, Will.

He clutches her hands, then slips back into
unconsciousness.

His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth
sees he wears a chain around his neck. She tugs it free,
revealing--

A GOLD MEDALLION. One side is blank. She turns it over --

A SKULL gazes up at her. Vaguely Aztec in design, but to
her eyes, it means one thing only:

 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
 You're a pirate.

She glances back at the crew. Sees Norrington, giving
orders, moving toward her.

She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision. Takes
the medallion from around his neck. Hides it under her
coat.

Norrington arrives.

 NORRINGTON
 Did he speak?

 ELIZABETH
 His name is Will Turner -- that's
 all I found out.

 NORRINGTON
 Very good.

Norrington hurries off. Elizabeth steals away to the stern
of the ship. Examines her prize -- the gold medallion. A
wisp of wind, and she looks up --

Out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a
ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner --

It has BLACK SAILS.

Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.

The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but not
the mizzen-top ... and there hangs the frightening skull
and crossbones of the Jolly Roger.

Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on
the flag is the same as the one on the medallion.

Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for
the black flag. As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to
TURN and GRIN at her --

Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight --

 EIGHT YEARS LATER

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM

-- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.

But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on
the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old
Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.

She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a
nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)

Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as
possible without moving. Might there be someone in the
room with her, looming over her?

She turns, ready for anything. She is alone.

Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp
besides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the
room to a dressing table, sits down.

She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches
into a space beneath it and removes --

The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not
lost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at it
as she absently returns the draw to its place --

A BOOMING knock on the door; Elizabeth jumps up, startled
knocking over her chair.

 SWANN (O.S.)
 Elizabeth? Is everything all
 right? Are you decent?

 ELIZABETH
 Yes -- yes.

She puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as
Swann enters, carrying a large box. A uniformed maid,
ESTRELLA, follows.

 SWANN
 Still abed at this hour? It's a
 beautiful day!

Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing:

Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL,
built on a natural harbor. On a bluff at the mouth of the
harbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined with
cannon.

 SWANN (CONT'D)
 I have a gift for you.

He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet
dress. She lets out an admiring gasp.

 ELIZABETH

 It's -- beautiful. May I inquire
 as to the occasion?

 SWANN
 Is an occasion necessary for a father
 to dote upon his daughter with gifts?

Elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened-
off dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box.

 SWANN (CONT'D)
 Although...I did think you could
 wear it to the ceremony today.

 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
 Ceremony?

 SWANN
 Captain Norrington's promotion
 ceremony.

Elizabeth peeks around the screen.

 ELIZABETH
 I knew it.

 SWANN
 Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a
 fine gentleman, don't you think?
 (no answer)
 He fancies you, you know.

Behind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.

 SWANN (CONT'D)
 Elizabeth? How's it coming?

ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and the medallion (still
around her neck) out of the way as the maid cinches her
into a corset over her slip. Estrella has her foot in
Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces tight.

 ELIZABETH
 Difficult ... to say.

 SWANN (O.S.)
 I'm told that dress is the very latest
 fashion in London.

 ELIZABETH
 (holding her breath)
 Women in London must have learned to
 not breath.

Estrella is finished. Elizabeth takes a breath -- and
winces.

A butler appears in the doorway of the room.

 BUTLER
 Governor? A caller is here for
 you.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER - DAY

The caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer,
looking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a long
presentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots on
the back of his calves, but it doesn't help.

 SWANN
 Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see
 you again!

The caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with a
watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.

 WILL
 Good day, sir.
 (holds out the case)
 I have your order.

Swann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is a
beautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it out
reverently.

 WILL (CONT'D)

 WILL (CONT'D)
 The blade is folded steel. That's
 gold filigree laid into the
 handle. If I may -

He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one
finger at the point where the blade meets the guard.

 WILL (CONT'D)

 Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly
 the full width of the blade..

 SWANN
 Impressive. .. very impressive.
 Commodore Norrington will be pleased,
 I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to
 your master.

Will's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he is
proud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the sword
around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.

 WILL
 (bows slightly)
 I shall. A craftsman is always pleased
 to hear his work is appreciated --

He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann -

Elizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may be
painful to wear, but holy smokes!

 SWANN
 Elizabeth! You look stunning!

Will tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles to
himself, and simply nods emphatically.

 ELIZABETH
 Will! It's so good to see you!

Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion
is hidden in the bodice of her dress).

 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
 I dreamt about you last night.
 Will reacts with surprise:
 "Really?

 SWANN
 Elizabeth, this is hardly
 appropriate -

 ELIZABETH
 (ignores her father)
 About the day we met. Do you
 remember?

 WILL
 I could never forget it, Miss
 Swann.

 ELIZABETH
 Will, how many times must I ask
 you to call me 'Elizabeth'?

 WILL
 At least once more, Miss Swann. As
 always.

Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his
response.

 SWANN
 Well said! There's a boy who
 understands propriety. Now, we must be
 going.

Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for
Elizabeth.

Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and
strides past Will.

 ELIZABETH
 Good day, Mr. Turner.

EXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY

Swann follows Elizabeth out the door.

 WILL
 Good day.

He watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the
driver.

 WILL (CONT'D)
 (to himself)
 Elizabeth.

IN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter.

 SWANN
 Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit
 more decorum in front of Commodore
 Norrington. After all, it is only

 through his efforts that Port Royal has
 become at all civilized.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAY

The skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in
buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky
promontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a
sign:

PIRATES - YE BE WARNED.

The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of
them. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in
the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling
rogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.

He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises a
tankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches his
attention. He jumps from the rigging -

-- and that's when we see that his is ship is not an
imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a
single sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon.

And it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.

Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to
control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the
promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.

The huge British dreadnought, H.M.S. Dauntless dominates
the bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the
H.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and
a mortar in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up at
the Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort
Charles.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAY

Smoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the
sail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock. The
HARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there
to catch a line and help Jack tie up.

 HARBORMASTER
 If you're out rolling scuppers in
 this tub, you're either incredibly
 brave or incredibly stupid.

 JACK
 It's remarkable how often those
 two traits coincide.

He starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besides
the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small
powder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off.

 HARBORMASTER
 It's a shilling for the dock
 space, and you're going to have to
 give me your name.

 JACK
 What do you say to three
 shillings, and we forget the name?

He tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormaster
considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside.

 HARBORMASTER
 Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past. Looks across
the water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles. Above the
Interceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony
is underway -

EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY

With choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword and
scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed
Navy man. He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it
out vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform.

Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and
Swann lets go. Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the
sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swann
steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps
back.

Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow
officers, turns again and nods to the audience -
dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families.
Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.

The silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping from
the Navy men.

In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out
beneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces.
Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material
of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her
discomfort.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK - DAY

Two sailors on sentry duty, MURTOGG and MULLROY, take
advantage of what little shade there is on the dock. But
when Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert.

 MURTOGG
 This dock is off-limits to
 civilians.

 JACK
 Sorry, I didn't know.

Music drifts down from Fort Charles. Jack looks up, shields
his eyes.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?
 You two weren't invited?

 MURTOGG
 No ... someone has to make sure
 this dock stays off-limits to
 civilians.

 JACK
 This must be some important boat.

 MULLROY
 Ship.

 JACK
 Ship.

 MURTOGG
 Captain Norrington's made it his
 flagship. He'll use it to hunt
 down the last dregs of piracy on
 the Spanish Lake.

 MULLROY
 Commodore.

 MURTOGG
 Right. Commodore Norrington.

 JACK
 That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it
 seems to me a ship like that --
 (indicates the Dauntless)
 -- makes this one here just a wee
 superfluous.

 MURTOGG
 Oh, the Dauntless is the power in
 these waters, true enough -- but
 there's no ship that can match the
 Interceptor for speed.

 JACK
 That so? I've heard of one, supposed to
 be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black
 Pearl?

Mullroy scoffs at the name.

 MULLR0Y
 There's no real ship as can match
 the Interceptor.

 MURTOGG
 The Black Pearl is a real ship.

 MULLROY
 No, it's not.

 MURTOGG
 Yes it is. I've seen it.

 MULLR0Y
 You've seen it?

 MURTOGG
 Yes.

 MULLROY
 You've seen the Black Pearl?

 MURTOGG
 Yes.

 MULLR0Y

 You haven't seen it.

 MURTOGG
 Yes, I have.

 MULLR0Y
 You've seen a ship with black sails
 that's crewed by the damned and
 captained by a man so evil that hell
 itself spat him back out?

 MURTOGG
 ... No .

 MULLROY
 No.

 MURTOGG
 But I've seen a ship with black sails.

 MULLR0Y
 Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by
 the damned and captained by a man so
 evil hell itself spat him back out
 could possibly have black sails and
 therefore couldn't possibly be any ship
 other than the Black Pearl. Is that
 what you're saying?

 MURTOGG
 ... no.

 MULLR0Y
 (turns back to Jack)
 Like I said, there's no real ship
 as can match -- Hey!

But Jack's not there. Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot
-

Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casually
examining the mechanism.

 MULLROY (CONT'D)
 You!

Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise. The
sailors hurry toward the gangplank.

 MULLROY (CONT'D)
 Get away from there! You don't
 have permission to be aboard
 there!

Jack spreads his hands in apology.

 JACK
 I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty
 boat. Ship.

The sailors study him suspiciously.

 MURTOGG
 What's your name?

 JACK
 Smith.

 MULLR0Y
 What's your business in Port
 Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ?

 MURTOGG
 And no lies!

 JACK
 None? Very well. You've rumbled
 me. I confess: I intend to
 commandeer one of these ships,
 pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go
 out on the account, do a little
 honest pirating.

 MURTOGG
 I said, no lies.

 MULLR0Y
 I think he's telling the truth.

 MURTOGG
 He's not telling the truth.

 MULLROY
 He may be.

 MURTOGG
 If he were telling the truth he
 wouldn't have told us.

 JACK
 Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't
 believe the truth if he told it to you.

Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --

EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY

Elizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly,
oblivious to the music and chatter.

 NORRINGTON
 May I have a moment?

He extends his arm. She takes it. He walks her away from
the party, toward the parapet. A rather too long of a
silence as Norrington works up his courage.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 (a burst)
 You look lovely. Elizabeth.

Elizabeth frowns, unable to focus. Norrington mistakes her
expression as disapproval.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 I apologize if I seem forward --
 but I must speak my mind.


 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 (working up his
 confidence to do so)
 This promotion confirms that I have
 accomplished the goals I set for myself
 in my career. But it also casts into
 sharp relief that which I have not
 achieved. The thing all men most
 require: a marriage to a fine woman.
 (beat)
 You have become a fine woman,
 Elizabeth.

 ELIZABETH
 I can't breathe.

 NORRINGTON
 (smiles)

 I'm a bit nervous, myself --

Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norrington.
She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself,
but it slides off -

-- and then she vanishes over the wall. Gone.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 Elizabeth! .

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY

Jack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside to see -

Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff. It seems to
take her a long time to reach the sea --

Elizabeth hits the water, narrowly missing the sharp rocks.
A wave breaks, and then she is washed out away from the
cliff, struggling feebly.

AT THE FORT, Norrington looks down --

NORRINGTON ELIZABETH!

He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive -- a
lieutenant, GILLETTE catches his arm.

 GILLETTE
 The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she
 missed them!

Norrington shakes off his arm, looks down -- and realizes
Gillette is right. He jumps down and runs --

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY

Jack, Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from the
sight.

 JACK
 Aren't you going to save her?

 MULLR0Y
 I can't swim.

Murtogg shakes his head -- neither does he.

 JACK
 (rolls his eyes)
 Sailors.

Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water. Norrington
and several other men pick their way down the cliffs. They
are too far away to get to her in time.

Jack scowls. He has no choice -- and it pisses him off.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Fine.

He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg;
then hands the belt to Mullroy.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Don't lose these.

And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth.

Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air '-
then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged -

UNDERWATER, Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious. The current
turns her, and the MEDALLION slips loose from her bodice.

The MEDALLION turns slowly, until the SKULL is fully
visible. A shaft of filtered sunlight hits it, and it
GLINTS -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - VARIOUS - DAY

FORT CHARLES: The British flag flies, blown from an
offshore breeze. Suddenly the wind dies, and the flag goes
limp.

ON THE DOCKS: Wood and metal fittings on lines bang against
masts. The wind dies, and there is silence.

ON THE EDGE OF TOWN: A CARIBE WOMAN feeds clucking
chickens, frowns when they all suddenly go quiet ...

IN THE VILLAGE: A weather vane moves slightly in the wind.
The wind stops, and all is still. And then ...

... the weather vane TURNS, and holds steady -- the wind
has picked up again, but now blows .from the sea toward the
land.

l)ON THE BEACH: an OLD SALT pulls a rope line, pauses.
Turns and gazes to the sky, frowning. The mangy hound at
his side starts BARKING incessantly -

ON THE DOCKS: The lines bang against the other sides of the
masts, the wind far stronger now.

FORT CHARLES: the British flag flies in the opposite
direction, snapping in the new onshore breeze.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - CLIFFSIDE - DAY

Norrington rushes down, intent on the climb. Beyond him,
past the rocky point, far out to sea, FOG gathers -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - OCEAN - DAY

UNDERWATER: the medallion hangs below Elizabeth's unmoving
form - - and then Jack is there. He wraps an arm around her
and makes for the surface.

ON THE SURFACE, Jack swims toward the dock, struggling. It
is .: far more difficult than it should be. He stops
stroking, and they submerge.

UNDERWATER: Jack realizes that it is Elizabeth's heavy
velvet dress that is weighing them down. He pulls at the
buttons on the back, and they give way. He skins her out of
the dress, and kicks away from it.

The dress falls like a cloud into darkness -

ON THE SURFACE: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more
quickly.

AT THE DOCK, Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul
Elizabeth out of the water.

Jack climbs up, exhausted. Elizabeth is on her back;
Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them.
Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth.

 MULLROY
 Not breathing.

Murtogg looks down; it seems hopeless. Jack steps up,
drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath.

 JACK

 Move.

He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the
knife -- Murtogg is shocked -

Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away.

Elizabeth remains still. And then -- she coughs up water
and gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack is
relieved.

 MULLROY
 I never would have thought of
 that.

 JACK
 Clearly, you've never been to
 Singapore.

Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg -
and that's when he spots -

The MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his "hand.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Where did you get this?

Before Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is at
Jack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in
fact, looking bright and sharp.

 NORRINGTON
 On your feet.

It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of her
clothes gone. He gets to his feet. The rest of Elizabeth's
erstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann.

 SWANN
 Elizabeth! Are you all right?

He strips off his jacket, drapes it around her.

 ELIZABETH
 Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore
 Norrington, do you intend to kill
 my rescuer?

Norrington looks at Jack. Jack nods as best he can with a
blade beneath his chin. Norrington sheathes his sword, and
extends his hand.

 NORRINGTON
 I believe thanks are in order.

Jack takes Norrington's hand gingerly. They shake -

-- and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's arm
toward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt -

-- exposing a BRAND on Jack's inner wrist: a large 'P.'

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 Had a brush-up with the East India
 Trading Company, did you ... pirate?

The others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained
--in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack. He
stands there, still holding the corset.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette,
 fetch some irons.

Norrington notices something else -- below the 'P' brand is
a tattoo: a small bird in flight across water.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

 JACK
 Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.

Norrington looks out at the bay.

 NORRINGTON
 I don't see your ship -- Captain.

 MURTOGG
 He said he'd come to commandeer one.

 MULLROY
 (to Murtogg)
 I told you he was telling the truth.
 (currying favor)
 These are his, sir.

He holds out Jack's pistol and belt. Norrington takes the
pistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt.

 NORRINGTON
 (to Jack)
 Extra powder, but no additional shot.

Jack shrugs. Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt,
opens it. He frowns at the reading. Moves the compass this
way and that, keeping it parallel to the ground.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 It doesn't bear true.

Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed. Norrington returns the
compass to the belt. Draws the sword half from the
scabbard.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 I half-expected it to be made of wood.

He slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to Mullroy.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 Taking stock: you've got a pistol with
 only one shot, a compass that doesn't
 point north ... and no ship. You are
 without a doubt the worst pirate I have
 ever heard of.

 JACK
 Ah, but you have heard of me.

Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack.

 NORRINGTON
 Carefully, lieutenant.

Elizabeth steps forward. Swann's jacket slips off her. She
is unconcerned, but he is intent on putting it back on her.

 ELIZABETH
 Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or
 not, this man saved my life.

 NORRINGTON
 One good deed is not enough to redeem a
 man of a lifetime of wickedness.

Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jack's wrists.

 JACK
 But it seems to be enough to condemn
 him.

 NORRINGTON
 (smiles)
 Indeed.

Now that Jack is safely chained, Norrington nods to his
men. All but one stow their weapons, and two step forward -

 JACK
 Finally.

Lightning-quick, he snaps the corset around the hand and
wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks. The pistol
sails into the water. Before anyone can react to that, Jack
has the manacle chain wrapped around Elizabeth's throat.

Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a
shield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 (backing away, toward land)
 Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and
 belt, please.

Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Commodore!

Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington. Norrington
holds them out to Jack.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?

Elizabeth is more angry than frightened.

ELIZABETH Miss Swann.

 JACK
 Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?

She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's
quicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her. He
jerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Now, if you'll be very kind?

She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him.

 ELIZABETH
 (as she works)
 You are despicable.

 JACK
 I saved your life; now you've
 saved mine. We're square.

Done. He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps
against the cargo gantry.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will
 always remember this as the day
 you almost caught Captain Jack
 Sparrow.

He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a
belaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up
to the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope -

Pistols fire -- and miss. Jack swings out, out, out, away
and around from the gantry.

Norrington has held his shot. With careful aim, he tracks
Jack's trajectory-

Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES. His shot
tears the rope -

-- as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he
snaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabs
hold of the far loop -- slides down the line -

-- drops to the deck of a ship. He runs, leaping to another
ship, then out of sight -

 NORRINGTON
 On his heels! Gillette, bring a
 squad down from the fort!

 (to Elizabeth)
 Elizabeth, are you -

 ELIZABETH
 Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go
 capture him.

Norrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurries
away. Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth.

 SWANN
 Here, dear ... you should wear this.

Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold.
Glances out at the bay -

-- where a THICK FOG moves across the top of the water. She
takes the jacket.

 ELIZABETH
 Thank you, Father ... and let that
 be the last of your fashion
 advice, please.

But she accepts his comforting embrace.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAY

The fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall. An
armed search party moves along the street. They glance down
an alley-

On the far side is another search party. The men nod to
each other, continue on.

A moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath
the eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles.

Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru
door set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY

Jack slips in through the door, takes a look around:

No windows. The forge is dark, lit by lanterns. Work-in-
progress is scattered about: wagon wheels, wrought iron
gates, pipes -- even a cannon with a crack in it. But every
tool is in place; the workbench is tidy and neat.

Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a
blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a
bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,
turns away.

Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled
sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing
coke furnace in the middle of the room.

Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the
chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack
sweats, grimaces at the pain -

Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an
anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on
the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge,
plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam
billows.

Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath
the manacle -- but his hands are free.

The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.

Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the
drunken Mister Brown in the corner.

 WILL
 Right where I left you.

Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The
sledge lying beside the anvil.

 WILL (CONT'D)
 (under his breath)
 Not where I left you.

He moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it --
but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps
back.

Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up,
toward the door. Will glares at him.

 WILL (CONT' D)
 (voice low and tight)
 You're the one they're hunting.
 The pirate.

Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then
frowns, regards Will.

 JACK
 You look familiar ... Have I ever
 threatened you before?

 WILL
 I've made a point of avoiding
 familiarity with pirates.

 JACK
 Ah. Then it would be a shame to
 put a black mark on your record.
 So if you'll excuse me ...

Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in
the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it
in hand.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Do you think this is wise, boy?
 Crossing blades with a pirate?

 WILL
 You threatened Miss Swann.

 JACK
 Only a little.

In response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack
appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.

Jack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading
feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost
impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 You know what you're doing, I'll
 give you that ... Excellent form
 ... But how's your footwork? If I
 step here -

He takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the
other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Very good! And if I step again,
 you step again. . .

 (continuing to step
 around the circle)
 And so we circle, circle, like
 dogs we circle. . .

They are now exactly opposite their initial positions.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Ta!

Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.

Will registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious
overhand motion, he throws his sword -

-- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the
latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls
on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the
way.

Jack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it
is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he
turns back to Will, he's smiling.

 JACK (CONT' D)
 That's a good trick. Except, once
 again, you are between me and the
 way out.
 (points his sword at the
 back door)
 And now you have no weapon.

Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an
anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward.

Will and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly,
Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at
Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.

Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming
him.

Will quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware
that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords,
knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Who makes all these?

 WILL
 I do. And I practice with them. At
 least three hours a day.

 JACK
 You need to find yourself a girl.
 (Will sets his jaw)
 Or maybe the reason you practice
 three hours a day is you've found
 one -- but can't get her?

A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with
anger.

 WILL
 No. I practice three hours a day
 so that when I meet a pirate ... I
 can kill him.

He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his
hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the
air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.

Jack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps
around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard
through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling -

So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the
ceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and
dodging around the furnace -

Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS
into Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up,
kicks with his feet, knocking Will back.

Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the
ceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second,
hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls
down, gets up -

Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.

Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit.
Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.

 WILL (CONT'D)
 You cheated.

 JACK

 (smiles; what do you expect?)
 Pirate.

Jack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the
door.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Move away.

 WILL
 No.

 JACK
 Move!

 WILL
 No. I can not just step aside and
 let you escape.

Jack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off
lasts for a long moment.

 JACK
 You're lucky, boy -- this shot's
 not meant for you.

Jack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack
-

Suddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's
skull. Jack crumples to the ground.

The front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the
room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground.

 NORRINGTON
 Excellent work, Mister Brown.
 You've aided in the capture of a
 dangerous fugitive.

 BROWN
 Just doing my civic duty.

Jack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles.

 NORRINGTON
 I believe you will always remember
 this as the day Captain Jack
 Sparrow almost escaped.

Norrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go.
Brown looks at his bottle -- broken.

 BROWN
 That ratter broke my bottle.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

The thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town.

The only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the

bluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey.

Above the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars. A
waxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow.

ANGLE - FORT CHARLES,

just below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly
deep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through the
water: the TOPMAST of a ship, BLACK SAILS billowing. Flying
from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull.

The Black Pearl has come to Port Royal.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it
between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed.

 ELIZABETH
 Nice and toasty. Thank you,
 Estrellia.

The maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins
reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around
her neck.

The lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn
it up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

Will, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron
ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops.

His attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter
and peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing,

he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. Takes it
down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his
mouth.

Three seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their
cell door. One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a
bone. The dog just sits and cocks its head.

 PRISONER
 Come here, boy... Want a nice,
 juicy bone?

In an adjoining cell, Jack lies on a pile of straw.

 JACK
 You can keep doing that forever,
 that dog's never going to move.

 PRISONER
 Excuse us if we ain't resigned
 ourselves to the gallows just yet.

EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

A noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard. Norrington
and Swann walk along the far wall.

 SWANN
 Has my daughter given you an
 answer yet?

 NORRINGTON
 No. She hasn't.

 SWANN
 Well, she had a taxing day...
 Ghastly weather tonight.

 NORRINGTON
 Bleak. Very bleak.

From the distance, there is a BOOM -

 SWANN
 What was that?

-- and then the WHISTLE of an incoming ball --

 NORRINGTON
 Cannon fire!

He tackles Swann as the wall of the parapet EXPLODES --

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

Jack sits up. There are more BOOMS -

 JACK
 I know those guns!

He peers out through the bars of the window. The other
prisoners crowd around their window as well.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 It's the Black Pearl.

 PRISONER
 (frightened)
 The Black Pearl? I've heard
 stories ... she's been preying on
 ships and settlements for near ten
 years ... and never leaves any
 survivors.

 JACK
 There are a lot of stories about
 the Black Pearl.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - NIGHT

The Black Pearl still cannot be seen -- but the fog lights
up around her with each boom of her guns. She's firing on
both sides now, hammering both the fort and the town.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - NIGHT

Streets, buildings, docks and ships shatter and explode
beneath the onslaught. Villagers panic, run for cover,
dodge flying debris as best they can. If this is not hell
on earth, then it's about to be --

-- long boats emerge out of the fog, carrying ARMED
PIRATES. They swarm from the boats, striking down
,villagers indiscriminately and setting fires.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

Will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of
his back. He puts a dirk in his belt, then a second and a
third. He picks up a second axe and a sword.

Will slides back the doors of the forge --

A woman runs past, chased by a ONE-ARMED PIRATE wearing a
yellow bandeau. Will backhands the axe square into his
chest, a deadly blow. Will heads out, up the street --

EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

The moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning
gallows and wooden roofs. Cannon fire continues to rain
down, but the fort's own cannons now return fire.

 NORRINGTON
 Governor! Barricade yourself in my
 office!
 (Swann hesitates)
 That's an order!

Swann turns to go -- but finds himself face-to-face with a
pirate -- KOEHLER, a handsome blond man with gold earrings.
Beyond Koehler, more pirates come up over the far wall.
Koehler grins and raises a cutlass -

-- Norrington's sword blocks Koehler's slash.

 NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
 They've flanked us! Men! Swords
 and pistols!

The battle is joined --

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH f S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below: even
through the fog, multiple fires are visible, and ships burn
in the harbor. Shouts and cries of pain. Cannon fire
ECHOES.

She notices movement directly below her window: two SHADOWY
FIGURES, approaching the house -- pirates. Elizabeth bolts
from her room--

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

She reaches the railing overlooking the foyer, and cries
out, just as the butler opens the door -- too late; there
is the BOOM of a gun, and the butler crumples.

Elizabeth ducks down in horror, peering through the
balusters. The pirates scan the foyer, searching. The
leader is PINTEL, a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head.

Suddenly Pintel looks up, and locks eyes with Elizabeth.
How could he know she was there?

 PINTEL
 Up there!

The pirates rush for the stairs. Elizabeth scrambles back
into the nearest room--

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth shuts the door, locks it, listens as the pirates
pound up the stairs --

 ESTRELLA
 Miss Elizabeth?

Elizabeth jumps. Estrella is right behind her, terrified.
They whisper:

 ESTRELLA (CONT'D)
 Are they come to kidnap you, miss?
 The daughter of the governor would
 be very valuable.

Elizabeth realizes she's right. There is the SLAM of a body
against the door.

 ELIZABETH
 Listen, Estrella -- they haven't
 seen you. Hide, and first chance,
 run for the fort .

Estrella nods. Another SLAM at the door -- it gives a bit -
-

Elizabeth shoves Estrella into the corner, between a tall
wardrobe and the wall. Dashes for the side door.

When the door smashes inward, it slams into the wardrobe,
and the maid cannot be seen. The pirates run in -- spot the
open side door, and run for it --

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pintel is the first through, and gets the pan of the bed
warmer in the face for his trouble -- he staggers back,
holding his nose --

INT. SITIING ROOM - NIGHT

Estrella breaks cover, runs for the hall, unnoticed.

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate,
but he catches it by the handle -- Elizabeth can't jerk it
free, so she wrenches it over -- the pan lid swings down,
BANGING the second pirate -- hot coals spill on his head,
sizzling.

Elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs -

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY/FOYER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

The pirates burst from the bedroom -- Pintel goes for the
stairs, but the second pirate vaults the handrail --

Estrella registers the butler's body, but continues out the
still-open front door at a dead run. Elizabeth follows --

The second pirate lands between Elizabeth and the front
door. His face is BURNED, his hair SMOLDERS -- he reaches -
-

Elizabeth pulls up short, runs the other way --

Pintel, on the stairs, grabs her by the hair -- Elizabeth

doesn't slow -- she spins, grabs Pintel's arm with both
hands and pulls him hard, belly-first, into the cap of the
newel post -- he lets go of her hair -- Elizabeth keeps
going

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth slams the double doors shut, throws the bolts.
The interior shutters are closed over the windows. Above
the fireplace are two crossed swords.

Elizabeth climbs on the firebox; she grabs one of the
swords by the hilt and pulls -- but it won't come free.
Both swords are securely attached to the wall. Damn!

A SMASH from the doors -- the pirates are relentless -

On the table is a platter with fruit, cheese and bread.
Elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter -

Like any bread knife, it has a round point. Elizabeth jabs
it into her palm -- it's useless as a weapon. Double damn!

The blade of a boarding axe breaches the door -- the
pirates will be through soon -- Elizabeth looks around -

INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

The doors give way; the pirates charge through -

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Empty. Elizabeth nowhere to be seen. Pintel and Smoldering
Pirate search, under the table, behind draperies.

 PINTEL
 We know you're here, poppet. Come
 out and we promise we won't hurt
 you.

Smoldering pirate gives him look -- he wants to hurt her
plenty. Pintel shakes his head: 'Don't worry, I'm lying.'

 PINTEL (CONT'D)
 We will find you, poppet ...
 You've got something of ours, and
 it calls to us!

INT. DUMBWAITER - NIGHT

Elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box, wrapped around the
double pulley ropes that go through the center.

 PINTEL (O.S.)
 The gold calls to us!

Elizabeth registers that -- she pulls out the medallion,
rubs

the gold with her thumb. This is their objective. Light

spills into the- box through gaps in the top as the door
above is slid open -- Elizabeth looks up through the gaps -

Pintel leers down at her.

 PINTEL (CONT'D)
 Hello, poppet.

Elizabeth works the ropes to lower the box. Pintel pulls
the other way; he's stronger, and the box rises. Elizabeth
tries to stop it -- wraps her left forearm through the rope
and lets it jam against the top of the box.

Elizabeth gasps at the pain, but the box stops. She saws at
the rope with the bread knife.

Smoldering pirate helps pull the rope, crushing Elizabeth's
forearm. Tears of pain on her face, she keeps sawing -

The rope parts, and the dumbwaiter box PLUMMETS -

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

From behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a CRASH, and a
cloud of dust. The door slides open, and Elizabeth clambers
out. Her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can
barely stand. She leans over the table, trying to recover.

The sound of running FOOTSTEPS gets louder ...

 ELIZABETH
 Please, no ...

Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ... and a
desperate idea occurs to her.

The pirates burst through the door. Elizabeth backs away,
holds the bread knife out to ward them off. They come
around either side of the table, stalking her -

 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
 (gasps it out)
 Par. .. Parlay!

Pintel can't believe his ears.

 PINTEL
 What?

 ELIZABETH
 Parlay! I invoke the right of
 parlay! According to" the Code of
 the Brethren, set down by the
 pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,
 you must take me to your Captain!

 PINTEL
 I know the code.

 ELIZABETH
 If an adversary demands parley,
 you can do them no harm until the
 parlay is complete.

 PINTEL
 It would appear, so do you.

 SMOLDERING PIRATE
 To blazes with the code!

He steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him.

 PINTEL
 She wants to be taken to the
 Captain, and she'll go without a
 fuss.

He looks to Elizabeth: 'right?' Elizabeth nods.

 PINTEL (CONT'D)
 We must honor the code.

Smoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk. He
grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - NIGHT

Will races along, momentarily free of the pirates. He spots
the Governor's Mansion in the distance. There are FIGURES
moving away from it -- Elizabeth, forced by the two
pirates.

Will hurries forward -

Suddenly a PIRATE jumps out from the shadows, slashes; Will
defends himself. The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow
bandana. Will hesitates -- didn't he already kill this guy?

The hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE, swinging
a flaming torch, to SLAM Will in the head from behind. Will
crumples.

The pirate lights a second torch, hands it to One-arm; they
hoot with delight and head off, setting fires as they go.

On the ground, Will doesn't move.

INT. FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

The wall of the cells EXPLODES inward. Jack pulls himself
out from under rubble. Moonlight spills in through the
gaping hole created by the cannon ball. Beyond it: freedom.

But it is centered on the other cell. The part of Jack's
cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.

 PRISIONER
 Praise be!

He and the other two scramble through.

 PRISONER (CONT'D)
 (back to Jack)
 My sympathies, friend - - you've
 no manner of luck at all!

The three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view.

Jack is alone. Cannon fire continues, occasional hits
shaking the fort. The dog cowers under a long bench, key
ring still in his mouth. Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks
up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog
forward.

 JACK
 It's all right, doggie ... come
 here,

boy. Come here, Spot. Rover. Fido?

To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench.
Jack continues to coax him closer.

The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the
dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He
BRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 What's the matter, boy?

The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out
through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him.

The door to the cell block bursts open. A pair of pirates
step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG.

 TWIGG
 This isn't the armory.

He turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack.

 KOEHLER
 (Dutch accent)
 Well, well... Look what we have
 here, Twigg. It's. Captain
 Sparrow.

 TWIGG
 Huh. Last time I saw you, you were
 all alone on a God-forsaken
 island, shrinking into the
 distance. I'd heard you'd gotten
 off, but I didn't believe it.

 KOEHLER
 Did you sprout little wings and
 flyaway?

 TWIGG
 His fortunes aren't improved much.

The two laugh. Jack doesn't. He steps forward, close to the
bars. This puts him in a spill of moonlight. He is tight
with fury.

 JACK
 Worry about your own fortunes. The
 lowest circle of hell is reserved
 for betrayers ... and mutineers.

Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that. Koehler lashes
out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars. Jack
clutches the pirate's wrist, looks down -

Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands
are skeletal.

Jack's eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm.

 JACK (CONT' D)
 You are cursed.

Koehler sneers, shoves Jack backwards, hard. Now out of the
moonlight, his hand is normal. Jack stares, realizing -

 JACK (CONT'D)
 The stories are true.

Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door. Looks back.

 KOEHLER
 You know nothing of hell.

And then they're gone.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

Amid the thunder of cannon fire, a longboat slips through
the fog. Elizabeth sits in the prow. Columns of water from
cannon balls geyser up around the boat.

The fog parts. Elizabeth looks up to see --

The Black Pearl, a tall galleon, its black sails looming
high above her. At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead
of a beautiful woman, arm held high, a small bird taking
wing from her outstretched hand.

The longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a
winch.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Lit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog. Smoke
hangs heavy above the deck.

Elizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail --
pirates spot her, and stare. One polite fellow steps

forward to offer his hand. She takes it and steps down. She
huddles, self-conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe.

 BOSUN
 I didn't know we was taking
 captives.

 PINTEL
 She's invoked the right of
 parlay... with Captain Barbossa.

ON THE POOP DECK -- an imposing FIGURE in silhouette stands
by the wheel, too far away to have heard Pintel's words.
But his head turns at the mention of his name.

The silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs. A cloud of
SMOKE obscures him -- and then, as if he skipped the
stairs, he strides out of the SMOKE on the main deck-

This is BARBOSSA. Despite the bright colors of clothing,
definitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley --
or anywhere, for that matter.

Elizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from
his eyes. But she musters her courage -

 ELIZABETH
 I am here to --

The Bosun SLAPS her.

 BOSUN
 You'll speak when spoken to!

His wrist is grabbed -- painfully -- by Barbossa.

 BARBOSSA
 And you'll not lay a hand on those
 under the protection of parlay!

 BOSUN
 Aye, sir.

Barbossa releases him. Turns to Elizabeth, smiles -- it
shows both silver and gold teeth.

 BARBOSSA

 My apologies, miss. As you were
 saying, before you were so rudely
 interrupted?

 ELIZABETH
 Captain Barbossa ... I have come
 to negotiate the cessation of
 hostilities against Port Royal.

Barbossa is both impressed and amused.

 BARBOSSA
 There was a lot of long words in
 there, miss, and we're not but
 humble pirates. What is it you
 want?

 ELIZABETH
 I want you to leave. And never
 come back.

Barbossa and the pirates laugh.

 BARBOSSA
 I am disinclined to acquiesce to
 your request.
 (helpfully)
 Means' No. '

 ELIZABETH
 Very well.

She quickly slips the medallion off, darts to the side
rail, dangles it over the side of the ship. The pirates go
quiet.

 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
 I'll drop it!

 BARBOSSA
 My holds are bursting with swag.
 That bit of shine matters to me
 ... Why?

 ELIZABETH
 Because it's what you're searching
 for. You've been searching for it
 for years. I recognize this ship.

 I saw it eight years ago, when we
 made the crossing from England.

 BARBOSSA
 (interested)
 Did you, now?

Elizabeth glares at him. She's getting nowhere.

 ELIZABETH
 Fine. I suppose if this is
 worthless, there's no reason to
 keep it.

She flips the medallion up, off her finger -

 BARBOSSA
 NO!

She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.

 BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
 You have a name, missy?

 ELIZABETH
 Elizabeth -
 (stops herself from
 saying "Swann"; then:)
 Turner.
 (embroidering)
 I'm a maid in the governor's
 household.
 (curtsies)
 Barbossa reacts to the name
 Turner: it confirms what he has
 suspected. The other pirates
 surreptitiously exchange glances
 and nods.

 BARBOSSA
 You've got sand, for a maid.

 ELIZABETH
 (curtsies again)
 Thank you, sir.

 BARBOSSA

 And how does a maid come to own a
 trinket such as that? A family
 heirloom, perhaps?

 ELIZABETH
 Of course.
 (offended)
 I didn't steal it, if that's what
 you mean.

 BARBOSSA
 No, no, nothing like that.
 (comes to a decision)
 Very well. You hand that over,
 we'll put your town to our rudder
 and ne'er return.

 ELIZABETH
 Can I trust you?

 BARBOSSA
 It's you who invoked the parlay!
 Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand
 it over, now... or these be the
 last friendly words you'll hear!

Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. She holds out
the medallion. He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like
hope.

 ELIZABETH
 Our bargain. . ?

Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun.

 BOSUN
 Still the guns, and stow 'em!
 Signal the men, set the flags, and
 make good to clear port!

For the first time since the attack began, the BOOMING of
the guns ceases. Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved.
The pirates hustle to follow orders. Barbossa turns away.

 ELIZABETH
 Wait! You must return me to shore!
 According to the rules of the
 Order of the Brethren -

Barbossa wheels on her.

 BARBOSSA
 First. Your return to shore was
 not part of our negotiations nor
 our agreement, and so I 'must' do
 nothing. Secondly: you must be a
 pirate for the pirate's code to
 apply. And you're not. And
 thirdly...

the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual
rules.

(grins gold and silver)

Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner.

Elizabeth stares in speechless terror -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - PRE-DAWN

As the Black Pearl turns out to sea, Elizabeth is led back
along the deck to the captain's cabin.

The fog starts to dissipate, turning to a light mist;
through it, the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of
dawn.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - PRE-DAWN

Will comes to, still where he fell, gets to his feet.

He takes in the devastation of Port Royal: the harbor is
dotted with burning and sunken ships; buildings are razed
and still smolder. The aftermath of hell on earth.

Will turns, and runs for the Governor's Mansion.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - MORNING

Will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. Calls
out:

 WILL
 Miss Swann! Elizabeth!

A terrible silence answers him. He spots an overturned
chair, fallen bookshelf -

INT. FORT CHARLES - NORRINGTON'S OFFICE - MORNING

Will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe.

 WILL
 They've taken her! They've taken
 Elizabeth!

A group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette
among others, gathered around a map. The map is so large it
drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a
chair.

 NORRINGTON
 We're aware of the situation.

 WILL
 We have to hunt them down -- and
 save her!

Swann's worry has made him short-tempered.

 SWANN
 Where do you propose we start? If
 you have any information that
 concerns my daughter, then share
 it! If anyone does, tell me!
 (Will is silent)
 Leave, Mr. Turner.

Murtogg has remembered something. He ventures it warily:

 MURTOGG
 That Jack Sparrow... he talked
 about the Black Pearl.

 MULLROY
 Mentioned it, is more what he did.

 MURTOGG
 Still --

 WILL
 We can ask him where it is --
 maybe he can lead us to it!

 SWANN

 That pirate tried to kill my
 daughter. We could never trust a
 word he said!

 WILL
 We could strike a bargain -

 NORRINGTON
 No. The pirates who invaded this
 fort left Sparrow locked in his
 cell. Ergo, he is not their ally,
 and therefore of no value.
 (through with Will)
 We will determine their most
 likely course, and launch a search
 mission that sails with the tide.

Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map.

 WILL
 That's not good enough. This is
 Elizabeth's life!

Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across
Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door.

 NORRINGTON
 Mr. Turner, this is not the time
 for rash actions.
 (low)
 Do not make the mistake of
 thinking you are the only man here
 who loves Elizabeth.
 (firm)
 Now, go home.

He opens the door, and then turns away. Will watches him
walk back to the desk. Will's face sets in resolve, and he
leaves.

INT. FORT CHARLES - JAIL CELLS - MORNING

Jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars. Even with
the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move. He hears
the sound of the door latch -

The door opens, and Will slips in. Looks around. Jack
lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and
unconcerned. Will marches straight up to the bars.

 WILL
 Are you familiar with that ship?
 The Black Pearl?

 JACK
 Somewhat.

 WILL
 Where does it make berth?

 JACK
 Surely you've heard the stories? The
 Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla
 de Mureta... an island that cannot be
 found -- except by those who already
 know where it is.

 WILL
 The ship's real enough. So its
 anchorage must be a real place. Where
 is it?

 JACK
 Why ask me?

 WILL
 Because you're a pirate.

 JACK
 And you want to turn pirate
 yourself?

 WILL
 Never.
 (beat)
 They took Miss Swann.

 JACK
 (he was right)
 So it is that you found a girl. Well,
 if you're intending to brave all and
 hasten to her rescue and so win fair
 lady's heart, you'll have to do it
 alone. I see no profit in it for me.

Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration. Jack
is surprised at the outburst. Will thinks ... makes a
decision.

 WILL
 I can get you out of here.

 JACK
 How? The key's run off.

 WILL
 (examines the cell)
 I helped build these cells. Those are
 hook-and-ring hinges. The proper
 application of strength, the door'll
 lift free. Just calls for the right
 lever and fulcrum. . .

Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will
is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past.

 JACK
 Your name is Turner.

Will gives him a puzzled look.

 WILL
 Yes. Will Turner.

Jack grins.

 JACK
 Will Turner...
 (he stands)
 I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've
 changed my mind. You spring me from
 this cell, and on pain of death, I'll
 you to the Black Pearl.
 (sticks out his hand)
 Do we have an accord?

Will gives him a suspicious look. The deal seems too good.
Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling. Will shakes it.

 WILL
 Agreed.

 JACK
 Agreed!

Will looks around, figures out what he needs. He makes a
chair his fulcrum, and levers the long bench under the
door. Pushes down -- it's hard work -- but the cell door
rises, and then falls forward, CRASHING down on the bench
and chair.

Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell.

 WILL
 Someone will have heard that.
 Hurry.

Will heads for the door. Jack searches the desk, cupboards.

 JACK
 Not without my effects.

 WILL
 We need to go!

Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass. Straps on
the belt, checks the shot in his pistol.

 WILL (CONT'D)
 Why are you bothering with that?

 JACK
 My business, Will. As for your business
 -one question, or there's no use going.
 (joins Will at the door)
 This girl -- what does she mean to you?
 How far are you willing to go to save
 her?

 WILL
 (no hesitation)
 I'd die for her.

 JACK
 Good.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - MORNING

The Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats
low in the water, heeled to one side, creaking on its
lines.

 JACK (O.S.)
 Ah, now there's a lovely sight!

Jack hops down into the boat. Prepares to make way.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report
 her. Honest men are slaves to their
 conscience, and there's no predicting
 'em. But you can always trust a
 dishonest man to stay that way...

Jack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock,
staring at the boat in dismay.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Come aboard.

 WILL
 I haven't set foot off dry land I was
 twelve, when the ship I was on
 exploded.
 (regards the boat)
 It's been a sound policy.

 JACK
 No worries there. She's far more
 likely to rot out from under us.

Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if its going to
capsize with the slightest movement. Jack hoists the sail.

 JACK (CONT'D)
 Besides, we are about to better
 our prospects considerably.

He nods toward the H.M.S. Dauntless, looming in the harbor.
Will whiteknuckles the gunwales.

 WILL
 We're going to steal a ship? That
 ship?

 JACK
 Commandeer. We're going to
 commandeer a ship. Nautical term.

 WILL
 It's still against the law.

 JACK

 So's breaking a man out of jail. Face
 it, Will: you may say you'll never be a
 pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring
 start.
 (smiling)
 My advice -- smile and enjoy it.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - MORNING

The Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against
the H.M.S. Dauntless. Will holds a stay line with iron
fists.

 WILL
 This is either crazy, or
 brilliant.

 JACK
 Remarkable how often those two
 traits coincide.

The Jolly Man nears the rudder of the much larger ship -

EXT. H. M. S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - MORNING

There's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen Navy
sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing
dice. Murtogg and Mullroy among them.

Suddenly, Jack and Will jump out, into the open -

brandishing pistols.

 JACK
 Everybody stay calm. We're taking
 over the ship!

 WILL
 (a beat)
 Aye! Avast!

Jack gives him a look, shakes his head: don't do that.

The sailors all look at them -- and then burst out
LAUGHING. They grin, shake their heads. Jack stands there,
grinning with them -- but his gun is still level. The
Lieutenant, GILLETTE, steps forward.

 GILLETTE

 You're serious about this.

Jack moves his pistol across, points it at Gillette.

 JACK
 Dead serious.

 GILLETTE
 You understand this ship cannot be
 crewed by only two men. You'll never
 make it out of the bay.

 JACK
 We'll see about that.

More guffaws from the crew. A couple sailors move forward,
hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand.

 GILLETTE
 Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed
 or wounded in this foolish enterprise.

 JACK
 Fine by me. We brought you a nice
 little boat, so you can all get back to
 shore, safe and sound.

 GILLETTE
 (a curt nod)
 Agreed. You have the momentary
 advantage, sir. But I will see you
 smile from the yard arm sir.

 JACK
 As likely as not.
 (calling)
 Will, short up the anchor, we've
 got ourselves a ship!

EXT. DAUNTLESS - STERN - MORNING
