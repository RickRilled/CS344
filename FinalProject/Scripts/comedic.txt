	  PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
          
          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
          
          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
          
          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
          
                                 RIDER
                    Hey -- sorry.
          
          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
          
                                 KAT
                    Leave it 
          
          He persists.
          
                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
          
          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.
          
          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
          
          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Did you change your hair?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    No.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You might wanna think about it
          
          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
          
          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
          
                                 BOY
                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Awesome shoes.
          
          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.
          
          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
          
          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I don't think so, ma'am
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.
          
          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
          
          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
          
          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I missed you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    With the teeth of your zipper?
          
          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You the new guy?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So they tell me...
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the 
                    tour.
          
          They head out of the office
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    So -- which Dakota you from?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    North, actually.  How'd you   ?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I was kidding. People actually live 
                    there?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by 
                    the cows, though.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    How many people were in your old 
                    school?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thirty-two.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Get out!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    How many people go here?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Couple thousand. Most of them evil
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through 
          the crowd as he points to various cliques.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    We've got your basic beautiful people. 
                    Unless they talk to you first, don't 
                    bother.
          
          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader 
          splendor.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Those 're your cowboys.
          
          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys  
          walk by.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That I'm used to.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.
          
          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled 
          around it.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.  
                    Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden 
                    movements around them.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Michael continues the tour
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    And these delusionals are the White 
                    Rastae.
          
          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets 
          lounge on the grass.  A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Big Marley fans.  Think they're black.  
                    Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a 
                    lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I 
                    mean.
          
          Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?
          
                                 DEREK
                           (very stoned)
                    Michael, my brother, peace
          
          Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the 
          cafeteria.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So where do you fit in all this?
          
          INT.  CAFETERIA - DAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Loud music and loud students.  Michael sits with a group of 
          studious-looking teens.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League, 
                    already accepted.  Someday I'll be 
                    sipping Merlot while those guys --
          
          He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various 
          passers-by.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    are fixing my Saab.  Yuppie greed is 
                    back, my friend.
          
          He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.
          
          Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO 
          MO.  Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael 
          without a look.
          
          Cameron is smitten
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That girl -- I --
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You burn, you pine, you perish?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Who is she?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't 
                    even think about it
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I could start with your haircut, but it 
                    doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to 
                    date until her older sister does.  And 
                    that's an impossibility.
          
          ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space 
          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English 
          Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that 
                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man 
                    and the Sea.  Any other comments?
                           (with dread)
                    Kat?
          
          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes 
          off her glasses and speaks up.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    I'm sorry?
          
                                 KAT
                    This book is about a guy and his 
                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial 
                    topic.
          
          The other students roll their eyes.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.
          
          JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, 
          makes fun of her from his row.
          
                                 JOEY
                    As opposed to a bitter self-righteous 
                    hag who has no friends?
          
          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
          
          Really gets fired up now
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess the school board thinks because 
                    Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's 
                    worthy of our time
          
          She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her 
          pill box.
          
                                 KAT

                    What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte?  
                    Simone de Beauvoir?
          
          Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a 
          crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY, 
          embroidered on his workshirt.
          
                                 PATRICK

          The class titters.  Kat wears an expression of intolerance
          
          INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Kat now sits before Miss Perky.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've 
                    been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
          
                                 KAT
                    Expressing my opinion is not a 
                    terrorist action.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Well, yes, compared to your other 
                    choices of expression this year, today's 
                    events are quite mild.  By the way, 
                    Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation 
                    went quite well, in case you're 
                    interested.
          
                                 KAT
                    I still maintain that he kicked himself 
                    in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    The point is Kat -- people perceive you 
                    as somewhat ...
          
          Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tempestuous?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the 
                    term used most often.
          
          She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    You might want to work on that
          
          Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the 
          counselor's.
          
                                 KAT
                    As always, thank you for your excellent 
                    guidance.

          Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in 
          big flowing handwriting.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                    I realize the language of Mr. 
                    Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, 
                    but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
          
          Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip 
          of her hair to CHASTITY.  Chastity opens the note and reads:
          
          INSERT - "JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY  
          GOD!"
          
          Chastity frowns to herself.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                           (continuing)
                    Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment 
                    on what you've read so far?
          
          Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Not really.
          
          The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
          
          MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side 
          trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her 
          notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Mandella -- since you're assisting us, 
                    you might as well comment.  I'm assuming 
                    you read the assignment.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Uh, yeah, I read it all
          
                                 TEACHER
                    The whole play^
          
                                 MANDELIA
                    The whole folio.  All the plays.
          
                                 TEACHER
                           (disbelieving)
                    You've read every play by William 
                    Shakespeare?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Haven't you?
          
          She raises a challenging eyebrow.  The stunned teacher 
          doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are 
          eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
          
                                 MANDELLA
          
          Your sister is so amazingly without.  She'll never read him.  
          She has no idea.
          
          Kat attacks
          
                                 KAT
                    The fact that you're cutting gym so you 
                    can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear 
                    his name, is a little without in itself 
                    if you ask me.
          
          Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his 
          friends, lighting up a cigarette.  Mandella notices her 
          staring.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who's that?
          
                                 KAT
                    Patrick Verona   Random skid.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone 
                    for a year? I heard he was doing porn 
                    movies.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm sure he's completely incapable of 
                    doing anything that interesting.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    He always look so
          
                                 KAT
                    Block E?
          
          Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into 
          Mandella's hand.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a 
                    very slow way to die.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Just a little.
          
          She eats.  Kat sees her wrist
          
                                 KAT
                    What's this?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    An attempted slit.
          
          Kat stares at her, expressionless.
          
                                 KAT
                    I realize that the men of this fine 
                    institution are severely lacking, but 
                    killing yourself so you can be with 
                    William Shakespeare is beyond the scope 
                    of normal teenage obsessions.  You're 
                    venturing far past daytime talk show 
                    fodder and entering the world of those 
                    who need very expensive therapy.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    But imagine the things he'd say during 
                    sex.
          
          Thinks a minute
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, say you do it.  You kill 
                    yourself, you end up in wherever you end 
                    up and he's there.  Do you really think 
                    he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound 
                    compulsive who failed volleyball?
          
          Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
          
          ACROSS THE COURTYARD
          
          As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS   One of 
          the cohorts elbows Joey.
          
                                 COHORT
                    Virgin alert.
          
          Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' good, ladies.
          
          Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Tragic.
          
          Doesn't respond
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from 
          their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can 
          of beans linger on the grass behind them.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why do girls like that always like guys 
                    like that?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Because they're bred to.  Their mothers 
                    liked guys like that, and their 
                    grandmothers before them. Their gene 
                    pool is rarely diluted.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He always have that shit-eating grin?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish 
                    I could say he's a moron, but he's 
                    number twelve in the class.  And a 
                    model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's 
                    rumored to have a big tube sock ad 
                    coming out.
          
          The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their 
          empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries 
          to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    You know French?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You mean I'd get a chance to talk to 
                    her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You could consecrate with her, my 
                    friend.
          
          Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.  Joey pulls up 
          beside her in his Viper.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (re her dress)
                    The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't 
                    you been reading your Sassy?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, and I noticed the only part of 
                    you featured in your big Kmart spread 
                    was your elbow.  Tough break.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (practically 
                           spitting)
                    They're running the rest of me next 
                    month.
          
          He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.  
          Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in 
          a convertible.
          
                                 KAT
                    The people at this school are so 
                    incredibly foul.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You could always go with me.  I'm sure 
                    William has some friends.
          
          They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and 
          Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
          
                                 JOEY
                    Need a ride, ladies?
          
          Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.  He 
          pulls away with a smile.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
          
          Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's a charming new development
          
          Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the 
          tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
          
          As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his 
          moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
          
                                 KAT
                           (yelling)
                    Remove head from sphincter!  Then 
                    pedal!
          
          Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry 
          at the delay.
          
          Cameron rushes over
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You all right?
          
          He slows to a stop
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, just a minor encounter with the 
                    shrew.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's her?  Bianca's sister?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
          
          Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's 
          grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint 
          jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
          - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of 
          her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds 
          several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. 
          
          Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she 
          types.
          
                                 KAT
                    "Undulating with desire, Adrienne 
                    removes her crimson cape, revealing her 
                    creamy --"
          
          WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type 
          obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a 
          doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
          
          I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before 
          Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.
          
          He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to 
          kiss Sharon on the cheek.
          
                                 SHARON
                    In the microwave.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Kat)
                    Make anyone cry today?
          
                                 KAT
                    Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.
          
          Bianca walks in.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Where've you been?
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (eyeing Walter)
                    Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
          
          She kisses him on the cheek
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hello, precious.
          
          Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs
          
                                 KAT
                    How touching.
          
          Walter holds up a letter to Kat
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?
          
          Snatches it away from him.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I got in
          
          Sharon looks up from her computer.
          
                                 SHARON
                    What's a synonym for throbbing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of 
                    the country.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I thought we decided you were going to 
                    school here.  At U of 0.
          
                                 KAT
                    You decided.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is there even a question that we want 
                    her to stay?
          
          Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at
          
                                 KAT
                    Ask Bianca who drove her home
          
                                 SHARON
                    Swollen...turgid.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca; upset)
                    Who drove you home?
          
          Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's 
                    this boy... and I think he might ask...
          
                                 WALTER
                    No! You're not dating until your sister 
                    starts dating.  End of discussion.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What if she never starts dating?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Then neither will you.  And I'll get to 
                    sleep at night.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, 
                    Daddy!
          
                                 KAT
                    This from someone whose diary is 
                    devoted to favorite grooming tips?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Enough!
          
          He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Do you know what this is?
          
          He hits the "play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from 
          the tape recorder.
          
          BIANCA AND WALTER
                           (in unison, by 
                           rote)
                    The sound of a fifteen-year-old in 
                    labor.
          
                                 WALTER
                    This is why you're not dating until 
                    your sister does.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But she doesn't want to date.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Exactly my point
          
          His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich 
                    before you women start dilating?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Tumescent!
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Sharon; as he 
                           leaves)
                    You're not helping.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.  Bianca arrives 
          in a flurry of blonde hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can we make this quick?  Roxanne 
                    Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an 
                    incredibly horrendous public break- up 
                    on the quad.  Again.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, I thought we'd start with 
                    pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
          
          BIANCA
          Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    Okay... then how 'bout we try out some 
                    French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
          
          Bianca smiles slowly
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're asking me out.  That's so cute.  
                    What's your name again?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (embarrassed)
                    Forget it.
          
          Bianca seizes an opportunity.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have 
                    a proper introduction ---
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Cameron.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the 
                    mercy of a particularly hideous breed of 
                    loser.  My sister.  I can't date until 
                    she does.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Seems like she could get a date easy 
                    enough...
          
          She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled.
          
                                 BIANCA
          
          The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be 
                    really popular when she started high 
                    school, then it was just like she got 
                    sick of it or something.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's a shame.
          
          She reaches out and touches his arm
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Gosh, if only we could find Kat a 
                    boyfriend...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Let me see what I can do.
          
          Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
          
          INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
          
          A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.  
          Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You're in school for one day and you 
                    ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you 
                    have no concept of the high school 
                    social code?
          
          Cameron grins away
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I teach her French, get to know her, 
                    dazzle her with charm and she falls in 
                    love with me.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Unlikely, but even so, she still can't 
                    go out with you.  So what's the
                    point?
          
          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab 
          tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles 
          as he tries to revive his frog.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What about him?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (confused)
                    You wanna go out with him?
          
          The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (impatient)
                    No - he could wrangle with the sister.
          
          Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What makes you think he'll do it?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He seems like he thrives on danger
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard 
                    he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just 
                    got out of Alcatraz...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They always let felons sit in on Honors 
                    Biology?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He 
                    sold his own liver on the black market 
                    so he could buy new speakers.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Forget his reputation.  Do you think 
                    we've got a plan or not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Did she actually say she'd go out with 
                    you?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's what I just said
          
          Michael processes this.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca, 
                    you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.  
                    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I thought you hated those people.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients 
                    when I get to Wall Street.
          
          A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee 
          Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
          
          He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another 
          frog, with full-on sound effects.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'll let you handle that.
          
          INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
          
          Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
          
          Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his 
          jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway.  Inside 
          several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
          
                                 PEPE
                    Some people like the Colombian, but it 
                    all depends on your acidity preference.  
                    Me?  I prefer East African and 
                    Indonesian.  You start the day with a 
                    Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian 
                    Sidamo in your cup, you're that much 
                    farther ahead than someone drinkin' 
                    Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I 
                    mean?
          
          Michael nods solemnly.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that 
          looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
          
          Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hey, there
          
          In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his 
          direction.
          
          Cameron slinks away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Later, then. 
          
          Michael watches, shaking his head.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria 
          tray with a magic marker.
          
          Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Are you lost?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Nope - just came by to chat
          
                                 JOEY
                    We don't chat.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Well, actually, I thought I'd run an 
                    idea by you.  You know, just to see if 
                    you're interested.
          
                                 JOEY
                    We're not.
          
          He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to 
          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (grimacing)
                    Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't 
                    you?
          
          Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    But she can't go out with you because 
                    her sister is this insane head case and 
                    no one will go out with her. right?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Does this conversation have a purpose?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So what you need to do is recruit a guy 
                    who'll go out with her.  Someone who's 
                    up for the job.
          
          Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his 
          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage 
          can, rather than in it.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          That guy?  I heard he ate a live duck once.  Everything but 
          the beak and the feet.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Exactly
          
          Joey turns to look at Michael.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          What's in it for you?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will 
                    on my part.
          
          He rises to leave and turns to the others.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    I have a dick on my face, don't I? 
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork 
          off his face as Cameron watches.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got him involved?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when 
                    you let the enemy think he's 
                    orchestrating the battle, you're in a 
                    position of power. We let him pretend 
                    he's calling the shots, and while he's 
                    busy setting up the plan, you have time 
                    to woo Bianca.
          
          Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You're one brilliant guy
          
          Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
          
                                 MICHAEL
          
          Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but 
          it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who 
          Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. 
          
          Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a 
          manly way for the others, now watching.
          
          INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is 
          smoking.
          
                                 KAT
                    So he has this huge raging fit about 
                    Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to 
                    his male-dominated, puking frat boy, 
                    number one golf team school. I have no 
                    say at all.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William would never have gone to a 
                    state school.
          
                                 KAT
                    William didn't even go to high school
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's never been proven
          
                                 KAT
                    Neither has his heterosexuality.
          
          Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to 
          stub out Mandella's cigarette. 
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    I appreciate your efforts toward a 
                    speedy death, but I'm consuming.
                           (pointing at her 
                           food)
                    Do you mind?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Does it matter?
          
                                 KAT
                    If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any 
                    school you want, precious.  Don't forget 
                    your tiara."
          
          They both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the 
          counter to place his order.
          
          Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Janice Parker told me he was a roadie 
                    for Marilyn Manson.
          
          Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Janice Parker is an idiot
          
          INT.  MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
          
          Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (looking at chart)
                    I don't understand, Patrick.  You 
                    haven't done anything asinine this week.  
                    Are you not feeling well?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Touch of the flu.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm at a loss, then.  What should we 
                    talk about? Your year of absence?
          
          He smiles his charming smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How 'bout your sex life?
          
          She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Why don't we discuss your driving need 
                    to be a hemorrhoid?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What's to discuss?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, 
                    and as far as I can tell, you're only 
                    slightly psychotic -- so why is it that 
                    you're such a fuck-up?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Well, you know -- there's the prestige 
                    of the job title... and the benefits 
                    package is pretty good...
          
          The bell RINGS.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Fine.  Go do something repugnant and 
                    give us something to talk about next 
                    week.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various 
          desks.
          
          Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to 
          get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Look, it's really easy.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, 
                    sister.
          
          Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (rotely)
                    It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not 
                    related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a 
                    political figure.  I do not live in 
                    South Africa.  My parents just spent a 
                    few too many acid trips thinking they 
                    were revolutionaries.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                    But you freed our people
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Your "people" are white, suburban high 
                    school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I 
                    have not freed you, Trevor.
                           (grabbing his arm 
                           dramatically)
                    Only you can free yourself.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as 
          can be

                                 CAMERON
                    Right.  See?  You're ready for the 
                    quiz.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I don't want to know how to say that 
                    though.  I want to know useful things.  
                    Like where the good stores are.  How 
                    much does champagne cost?  Stuff like 
                    Chat.  I have never in my life had to 
                    point out my head to someone.

                    That's because it's such a nice one.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Forget French.
          
          She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    How is our little Find the Wench A Date 
                    plan progressing?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, there's someone I think might be 
                    --
          
          Bianca's eyes light up
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Show me
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. 
          Bianca plays it cool.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Give me a sign when he walks by.  And 
                    don't point.
          
          The bell RINGS.  Kids flood past.  Then Patrick saunters by 
          with Scurvy.  Cameron nudges Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    There.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where?
          
          Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across 
          Patrick's path.  Patrick shoves him back against the wall 
          without a thought.  Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca's 
          feet.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I guess he didn't see me 
                           (calling after 
                           Patrick) 
                                     Some other time --
          
          Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in  her eye.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    My God, he's repulsive. He's so 
                    perfect!
          
          INT. GYM CLASS - DAY 
          
          Several volleyball games are being played.
          
          Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach 
          Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym 
          clothes.  They pull him aside roughly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (shrugging them 
                           off)
                    What?
          
          Joey points
          
          JOEY See that girl?
          
          Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the 
          ball into some poor cowboy's face.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah
          
                                 JOEY 
                    What do you think?
          
          Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared 
          of her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Two legs, nice rack...
          
                                 JOEY
                    Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out 
                    with her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You just said
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need money to take a girl out
          
                                 JOEY
                    But you'd go out with her if you had 
                    the cake?
          
          Patrick stares at Joey deadpan.  His dislike for the guy 
          obvious.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had 
                    the plane.
          
          Joey smiles.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, 
                    you do the honors.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're gonna pay me to take out some 
                    girl?
          
                                 JOEY
                    I can't date her sister until that one 
                    gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.  
                    She doesn't want a boyfriend.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    How much?
          
                                 JOEY
          
          Twenty bucks each time you take her out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I can't take a girl like that out on 
                    twenty bucks.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Fine, thirty.
          
          Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Take it or leave it.  This isn't a 
                    negotiation.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fifty, and you've got your man.
          
          Patrick walks away with a smile
          
          EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
          
          Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice 
          session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over 
          the field.
          
          Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette 
          dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
          
          MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                           (proudly) 
                    Good run, Stratford.
          
          Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick 
          hops down to follow.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Hey. Girlie.
          
          Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (smiles brightly)
                    Sweating like a pig, actually.  And 
                    yourself?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    There's a way to get a guy's attention.
          
                                 KAT
                    My mission in life.
          
          She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, 
                    you see, it worked.  The world makes 
                    sense again.
          
          Patrick's eyes narrow.  He steps closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Pick you up Friday, then
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, right.  Friday.
          
          PATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone
          
                                 PATRICK
                    The night I take you to places you've 
                    never been before.  And back.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?  
                    Do you even know my name, screwboy?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know a lot more than that
          
          Kat stares at him.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Doubtful.  Very doubtful.
          
          She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (calling after her)
                    You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
          
          Scurvy appears at his side
          
                                 SCURVY
                    So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a 
                    new Blaupunkt.
          
          ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He took the bait.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, 
          and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.
          
          She wacks Bianca away.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you ever considered a new look? I 
                    mean, seriously, you could have some 
                    potential buried under all this 
                    hostility.
          
          Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
          
                                 KAT
                    I have the potential to smack the crap 
                    out of you if you don't get out of my 
                    way.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you at least start wearing a bra?
          
          Kat SLAMS her door in response.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit
          
          SCURVY You up for a burger?
          
          Patrick looks in his wallet.  It's empty.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books.  Patrick 
          appears at her side, smiling.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          Kat doesn't answer
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    You hate me don't you?
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't really think you warrant that 
                    strong an emotion.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at 
                    the track with me.
          
                                 KAT 
                    And why would I do that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, 
                    you with money in your eyes, me with my 
                    hand on your ass...
          
                                 KAT
                    You -- covered in my vomit.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Seven-thirty?
          
          She slams her locker shut and walks away
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in  her 
          teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.  She 
          finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
          
          She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her 
          car
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
          
          Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Are you following me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I was in the laundromat. I saw your 
                    car. Thought I'd say hi.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Hi
          
          She gets in and starts the car.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not a big talker, are you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Depends on the topic. My fenders don't 
                    really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
          
          She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper, 
          which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
          
          Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- do you mind?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Not at all
          
          They continue on into the store.  Kat stares at them in 
          disbelief...
          
          Then BACKS UP
          
          Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious 
          Viper.
          
          Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the 
          liquor store.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing) 
                    You fucking bitch!
          
          Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.  Smiling 
          sweetly.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
          
                                 WALTER
                    My insurance does not cover PMS
          
                                 KAT
                    Then tell them I had a seizure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You 
                    punishing me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I thought you were punishing me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why can't we agree on this?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because you're making decisions for me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    As a parent, that's my right
          
                                 KAT
                    So what I want doesn't matter?
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're eighteen.  You don't know what 
                    you want.  You won't know until you're 
                    forty-five and you don't have it.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (emphatic)
                    I want to go to an East Coast school! I 
                    want you to trust me to make my own 
                    choices.  I want --
          
          Walter's BEEPER goes off
          
                                 WALTER
                    Christ!  I want a night to go by that 
                    I'm not staring a contraction in the 
                    face.
          
          He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing 
          Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.
          
                                 JOEY
                    When I shell out fifty, I expect 
                    results.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm on it
          
                                 JOEY
                    Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't 
                    count as a date.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I got her under control. She just acts 
                    crazed in public to keep up the image.
          
          Joey sees through the bluff
          
                                 JOEY
                    Let me put it to you this way, if you 
                    don't get any action, I don't get any 
                    action.  So get your ass on hers by the 
                    end of the week.
          
          Joey starts to walk off
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I just upped my price
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (turning)
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    A hundred bucks a date.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Forget it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget her sister, then.
          
          Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker,  
          then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing 
          scowl.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better hope you're as smooth as you 
                    think you are, Verona.
          
          Patrick takes the money with a smile.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY 
          Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?
          
          Bianca glares at him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    A "copine" is someone you can count on.  
                    An "ami" is someone who makes promises 
                    he can't keep.
          
          Cameron closes the French book
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got something on your mind?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I counted on you to help my cause. You 
                    and that thug are obviously failing.  
                    Aren't we ever going on our date?
          
          He melts
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You have my word.  As a gentleman
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're sweet.
          
          She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches 
          her toss her hair back
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (appreciative)
                    How do you get your hair to look like 
                    that?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days.  
                    And I never, ever use a blowdryer 
                    without the diffuser attachment.
          
          Cameron nods with interest.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You know, I read an article about that.
          
          Bianca looks surprised.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did?
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and 
          Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (without turning 
                           around) 
                    Say it
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (clearing his 
                           throat) 
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Whatever the hell it is you're standin' 
                    there waitin' to say.
          
          Cameron bravely steps forward
          
                                 CAMERON
                    We wanted to talk to you about the 
                    plan.
          
          Patrick turns toward them.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What plan?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The situation is, my man Cameron here 
                    has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What is it with this chick?  She have 
                    three tits?
          
          Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I think I speak correctly when I say 
                    that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than 
                    say -- Joey Dorsey's.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm 
                    just in this for the cash.
          
          Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his 
          beloved Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    That's where we can help you.  With 
                    Kat.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    So Dorsey can get the girl?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the 
                    big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set 
                    this whole thing up so Cameron can get 
                    the girl.
          
          Patrick smiles.  He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in 
          this game.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You two are gonna help me tame the wild 
                    beast?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (grinning) 
                    We're your guys.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    And he means that strictly in a non- 
                    prison-movie type of way.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Yeah -- we'll see.
          
          He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and 
          Cameron grinning at each other.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    We're in.

          Princeton Grad Bogey Lowenstein proudly presents a Saturday 
          night bash at his abode.  Casual attire".
          
          Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    This is it.  A golden opportunity. 
                    Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    In that case, we'll need to make it a 
                    school-wide blow out.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Will Bogey get bent?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself 
                    with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

          an homage to Joey's "modeling" career.  Cheesy PRINT ADS of 
          him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc. 
          -- adorn the locker door.

                    I think I like the white shirt
          
          Joey nods thoughtfully.

                    Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if 
                    you won't be there.
          
          He taps her on the nose and she giggles
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM 
          Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure have.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (pouting)
                    I really, really, really wanna go, but 
                    I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem 
                    to be goin' for him.
          
          He fishes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing) 
                    She's not a...
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of 
                    Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm 
                    pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex 
                    tendencies.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So that's the kind of guy she likes? 
                    Pretty ones?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say 
                    is that she'd dip before dating a guy 
                    that smokes.
          
          Cameron furiously takes notes
          
                                 CAMERON
                    All right.  What else is she partial 
                    to?
          
          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 
          Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.
          
          He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the 
          bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.
          
          Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our 
          two non-deviants pass through.
          
          Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    What've you got for me?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I've retrieved certain pieces of 
                    information on Miss Katarina Stratford I 
                    think you'll find helpful.
          
          Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Patrick)
          
          One question before we start -- should you be drinking 
          alcohol when you don't have a liver?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?!
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Good enough.
          
          Cameron looks up at Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Number one.  She hates smokers
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    It's a lung cancer issue
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Her favorite uncle
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Dead at forty-one.
          
          Patrick sits up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Are you telling me I'm a - 
                           (spits the word 
                           out)
                    "non-smoker"?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Just for now.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat 
                    likes -- pretty guys.
          
          This is met with silence.  Then:
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?  You don't think I'm pretty?
          
          Michael smacks Cameron
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He's pretty!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Okay!  I wasn't sure
          
          Cameron goes back to the list.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist 
                    prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of 
                    the indie-rock persuasion".
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what does that give me?  I'm 
                    supposed to buy her some noodles and a 
                    book and sit around listening to chicks 
                    who can't play their instruments?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Ever been to Club Skunk?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow 
                    night.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Don't make me do it, man
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Assail your ears for one night.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's her favorite band.
          
          Patrick groans
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I also retrieved a list of her most 
                    recent CD purchases, courtesy of 
                    American Express.
          
          He hands it over.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Michael -- did you get this information 
                    "illegally"?
          
          Michael puts a finger to his lips.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I prefer to think of it simply as an 
                    alternative to what the law allows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm likin' you guys better
          
          He looks down at the list of CDs.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    This is really music?
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with 
          indie rock band posters and flyers.
          
          Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up 
          Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you turn down the Screaming 
                    Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.
          
          Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning 
          down the volume.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Don't tell me you're actually going 
                    out?  On a school night, no less.
          
          Kat shoots her a glare
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing; 
                           excited)
                    Oh my God, does this mean you're 
                    becoming normal?
          
                                 KAT
                    It means that Gigglepuss is playing at 
                    Club Skunk and we're going.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (disappointed)
                    Oh, I thought you might have a date
                           (beat)
                    I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, 
                    but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party Saturday night?
          
                                 KAT
                    What do you think?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I think you're a freak.  I think you do 
                    this to torture me.  And I think you 
                    suck.
          
          She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her.   Kat 
          doesn't bat an eye.  She grabs her purse and opens the door
          
                                 KAT 
                    Let's hit it.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the 
          line of kids below.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her 
          fake ID.  The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically 
          mono-syllabic.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (whispering to Kat) 
                    You think this'll work?
          
                                 KAT 
                    No fear.
          
          They approach Bruce.  Kat puts on her happy, shiny face
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!
          
          Bruce looks the girls up and down.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    I can count.
          
          He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, 
          wearing a face that could only be described as "I AM a 
          Victoria's Secret model."
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    I'll bet you can..
          
          She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.  Bruce stares 
          at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Go ahead.
                           (to Mandella)
                    And you
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (all come hither)
                    Yes?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Take it easy on the guys in there.
          
          Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows 
          behind, shaking her head.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked 
          PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the 
          boy's inside pocket.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Next time, leave the Bic at home, 
                    Skippy.
          
                                 SKIPPY
                    It's a bottle opener.
          
          Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Verona, my man.
          
          They shake.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Always a pleasure, Brucie.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss 
                    fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen 
                    belly-button ring for you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of 
                    minors come in?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Never
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. 
                    The other one kinda short and 
                    undersexed?
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Just sent 'em through.
          
          Patrick starts to go in
          
                                 BRUCE 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- what happened to that chick you 
                    brought last time?  The one with the 
                    snake?
          
          Patrick laughs and goes into the club
          
          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their 
          bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.
          
          Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss 
          finishes a song.
          
                                 LEAD SINGER
                    Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and 
                    we're from Olympia.
          
          A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to 
          scream.
          
                                 BOY (0.S.)
                    Pet my kitty!
          
                                 LEAD SINGER 
                    Meow
          
          They rev into their next song. 
          
          NEAR THE STAGE  
          
          Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the 
          opening chords of the song, they look at each other and 
          scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be 
          having a better time.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks 
          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and 
          Mandella singing along.
          
          HIS POV
          
          The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. 
          None of her usual "attitude".  Patrick is transfixed.  And 
          most definitely attracted.
          
          NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (shouting)
                    I need agua!
          
          She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR
          
          She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's 
          waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing to 
                           herself) 
                    Shit
          
          She sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks 
          away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed.
          
          The bartender arrives
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (shouting) 
                    What can I get you?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Two waters.
          
          She looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the 
          band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she 
          marches off, forgetting to pay.
          
          She walks up to Patrick.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing) 
                    You're not fooling anyone.
          
          Patrick looks at her, surprised
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    hey.  Great show, huh?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
          
          If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it 
          over with.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    Excuse me?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    That's what you want, isn't it?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling; gesturing 
                           toward the band)
                    Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it 
                    for me.
          
          Kat steams.  And watches him watch the band
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    You're not surrounded by your usual 
                    cloud of smoke.
          
          The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know.  I quit.
          
          He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.  She moves 
          closer.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Oh, really?
          
          He motions toward the stage
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill 
                    or The Raincoats, but they're right up 
                    there.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know who The Raincoats are?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Why, don't you?
          
          She's completely taken aback.  He uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I watched you out there   I've never 
                    seen you look like that
          
          Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          Her cheeks pinken.
          
          His cocky side is back in a flash
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    Come to that party with me.
          
          At that moment, the band starts another SONG
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling) 
                    What?
          
          The bartender approaches.
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (to Kat, yelling) 
                    You forgot to pay!
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    I got it, Rick.
          
          He tosses some bills on the bar
          
          Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to 
          figure out his motive.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing; 
                           yelling) 
                    Nine-thirty then.
          
          A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she 
          can't hear a word he's saying.  She gives him one last look 
          and heads back into the crowd.
          
          Patrick smiles.  She didn't say no this time.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst 
          them.  A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick 
          coasts by in his truck.  The gears GRIND.  He yells out the 
          window.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    What'd he say?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Who cares?
          
          Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Has he importun'd you with love in 
                    honourable fashion?
          
          Kat glances sharply at her.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (continuing; off 
                           her look)
                    Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor 
                    of romance.  You're the one that wants 
                    to march on Washington every five 
                    minutes.
          
          Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Gigglepuss was so beyond.
          
          Mandella nods.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    They were.  I only wish William could 
                    have been here to witness the rebirth of 
                    punk rock with us.
          
          Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the 
          car.
          
                                 KAT
                    So true.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So, then she says that she almost 
                    didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that 
                    dress because she thought she was 
                    mixing, you know, genres. And the fact 
                    that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -
                    "really meant something."
          
          Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    You told me that part already.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hell, I've just been going over the 
                    whole thing in my head and -
          
          Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder.  
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Hey.  Dingo Boingo
          
          Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around 
          slowly
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing; to 
                           Michael)
                    I hear you're helpin' Verona.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You and Verona?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What?  We took bathes together when we 
                    were kids.
          
          It's incredibly obvious that he's lying.  Joey eyes him then 
          turns to Cameron.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's your gig in all this?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm just the new guy.
          
          Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his 
          shirt and twisting it.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better not fuck this up.  I'm 
                    heavily invested.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- it's all for the higher good 
                    right?
          
          Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker 
          for good measure, as he walks away-
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Is it about me?
          
          EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and 
          annoyed.
          
          The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You're completely demented.
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (cheery)
                    See you next week!
          
          Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
          
          Miss Perky watches in horror
          
          MISS PERKY
          You two know each other?
          
                                 PATRICK/KAT 
                    Yeah/No.
          
          Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Patrick)
                    Dear God, stay away from her.  If you 
                    two ever decided to breed, evil would 
                    truly walk the earth.
          
          Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then 
          smiles-
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          The lights are on, illuminating the yard
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room.  MUSIC is 
          blaring and the door is shut.  Bianca looks at her watch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    She's obviously not going.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak 
          past.  Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.  The girls freeze.
          
          Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich 
          The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I --
          
                                 WALTER
                    And where're you going?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    If you must know, we were attempting to 
                    go to a small study group of friends.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Otherwise known as an orgy?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew 
                    you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria 
                    Steinem" over there isn't going --
          
          She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes 
          downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her 
          relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
          school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen.
          
          Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Do you know about any party? Katarina?
          
          Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an 
          apple
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, people expect me to be there!
          
                                 WALTER
                    If Kat's not going, you're not going.
          
          Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're ruining my life'  Because you 
                    won't be normal, I can't be normal.
          
                                 KAT 
                    What's normal?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but 
                    you're too busy listening to Bitches Who 
                    Need Prozac to know that.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
          
          Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can't you forget for just one night 
                    that you're completely wretched?
          
                                 KAT
                    At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked 
                    hedge-pig.
          
          Bianca tosses her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like I'm supposed to know what that 
                    even means.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard 
                    of him?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's 
                    boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not 
                    allowed to go out, I should obsess over 
                    a dead guy, too.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Girls
          
          Kat stares Bianca down
          
                                 KAT
                    I know about the goddamn party.  I'm 
                    going.
          
          Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst 
          into gleeful screams.
          
          A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, God.  It's starting.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy.
          
          Walter looks dazed.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Wear the belly before you go.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, no!
          
                                 WALTER
                    Just for a minute
          
          He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
          pregnancy belly.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I want you to realize the weight of 
                    your decisions.
          
          He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You are so completely unbalanced.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Can we go now?

                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca)
                    Promise me you won't talk to any boys 
                    unless your sister is present.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Why?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Because she'll scare them away.
          
          Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall 
          table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the 
          door and...
          
          There stands Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nine-thirty right?
          
          Kat's in shock
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I'm early.
          
          She holds up her keys
          
                                 KAT 
                    I'm driving.
          
          He peeks in behind her.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Who knocked up your sister?
          
          INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a 
          pro, handing out cigars and martinis.
          
                                 BOGEY
                    Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the 
                    right, shots in the kitchen.
          
          The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat 
          pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and 
          hollering within the jock crowd.
          
          Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey 
          sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the 
          doorway.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
          
          Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his 
          forehead.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline 
                    just recede?
          
          He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's 
          already walking away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Where ya goin?
          
                                 KAT
                    Away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Your sister here?
          
          Kat's face shows utter hatred
          
                                 KAT 
                    Leave my sister alone.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (smirking) 
                    And why would I do that?
          
          A RUCKUS sounds from the next room
          
                                 JOCK 
                    A fight!
          
          The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash 
          their cupfuls on each other.
          
                                 COFFEE KID #1
                    That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you 
                    Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
          
          Caffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to 
          watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into 
          the kitchen.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Just who I was looking for.
          
          He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out
          
                                 KAT 
                                 BIANCA
          
          Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
          
          A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts 
          another.
          
          GUY
          Drink up, sister.
          
          Patrick walks up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's this?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (mocking)
                    "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that 
                    what you're supposed to do at a party?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I say, do what you wanna do.
          
                                 KAT
                    Funny, you're the only one
          
          She downs another.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Cameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his 
          beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and 
          dishes dirt simultaneously.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (high-fiving a 
                           jock)
                    Moose, my man! 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters 
                    have already started calling.
          
          Cameron nods intently
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing; 
                           grabbing his belt)
                    Yo, Clem. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new 
                    Leanne Rimes. 
                           (with a Jamaican 
                           swagger)
                    Ziggy, peace, bra. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Prefers a water pipe, but has been 
                    known to use a bong.
          
          Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, 
          and points Cameron's body in her direction.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)

          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where did he go?  He was just here.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Who?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Joey.
          
          Cameron walks over.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Evening, ladies.
          
          Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Looks like things worked out tonight, 
                    huh?
          
          Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You know Chastity?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I believe we share an art instructor
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Great
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Would you mind getting me a drink, 
                    Cameron?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Certainly
                    Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
          
          Bianca gives him a tense smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Surprise me.
          
          He heads for the kitchen.  Joey walks up and grabs her 
          around the waist.
          
          She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just 
          as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and 
          straw -- in his hand.
          
          Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, 
          then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.
          
          Michael appears.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy 
                    just picks up a girl and carries her 
                    away while you're talking to her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're 
                    making progress.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No, I ' m not.
          
          He smacks himself in the head
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    She used me!  She wants to go out with 
                    Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!
          
          Michael pats him on the shoulder.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    At least you're self-aware
          
          BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a 
          drunken group hug singing "I Shot the Sheriff".  Kat has 
          another shot glass in hand.
          
          Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured 
          cheerleader.  He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes 
          then looks away.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer
          
                                 JOEY
                    So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog 
                    thing going -- and the tube sock gig " 
                    that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up 
                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Queen Harry?
          
                                 JOEY
                    It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, 
                    like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
          
          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting 
          difficult.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Neat...
          
                                 JOEY
                    My agent says I've got a good shot at 
                    being the Prada guy next year.
          
          He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.  Bianca 
          takes the opportunity to escape.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'll be right back.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.  Chastity 
          applies lip-gloss in the mirror.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He practically proposed when he found 
                    out we had the same dermatologist. I 
                    mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, 
                    but he's not exactly relevant party 
                    conversation.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Is he oily or dry?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Combination.  I don't know -- I thought 
                    he'd be different.  More of a 
                    gentleman...
          
          Chastity rolls her eyes
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Bianca, I don't think the highlights of 
                    dating Joey Dorsey are going to include 
                    door-opening and coat-holding.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're 
                    supposed to want to go out with are the 
                    ones we actually want to go out with, 
                    you know?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    All I know is -- I'd give up my private 
                    line to go out with a guy like Joey.
          
          There's a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very 
          drunken Kat.
          
                                 KAT
                    Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need 
                    to tell you --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (cutting her off)
                    I really don't think I need any social 
                    advice from you right now.
          
          Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
          
          Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Maybe you should let me have it.
          
          Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go
          
                                 KAT
                    I want another one
          
          Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting 
          him from his task.
          
                                 JOEY
                    My man
          
          As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of 
          dancing people in the dining room.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (annoyed)
                    It's about time.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    A deal's a deal.
          
          He peels off some bills
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    How'd you do it?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Get her to act like a human
          
          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and 
          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. 
          She's almost burlesque.
          
          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on
          
          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts 
          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.
          
          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. 
          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Okay?
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm fine. I'm
          
          She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs  
          her again, bracing her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not okay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I just need to lie down for awhile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to 
                    sleep
          
                                 KAT
                    I know, just let me sleep
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What if you have a concussion? My dog 
                    went to sleep with a concussion and woke 
                    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell 
                    the difference...
          
          She tries to sit on the floor
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, 
                    okay?
          
          He pulls her back to her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    C'mon, let's walk
          
          INT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs 
          his arm.
          
          CAMERON We need to talk.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron, I'm a little busy
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's off. The whole thing.
          
          Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h 
          back on her feet.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What 're you talking about?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She's partial to Joey, not me
          
          Patrick doesn't have time for this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron -- do you like the girl?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (impatient)
                    Then, go get her
          
          Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron 
          stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice
          
          EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
          
                                 KAT
                    This is so patronizing.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Leave it to you to use big words when 
                    you're shitfaced.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why 're you doing this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I told you
          
                                 KAT
                    You don't care if I die
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, I do
          
                                 KAT
                    Why?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because then I'd have to start taking 
                    out girls who like me.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like you could find one
          
                                 PATRICK
                    See that?  Who needs affection when 
                    I've got blind hatred?
          
                                 KAT
                    Just let me sit down.
          
          He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a 
          swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How's that?
          
          She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then 
          FALLS over backward.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus.  You're like a weeble
          
          Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the 
          swing to keep her entertained.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Why'd you let him get to you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who? 
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate him.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big 
                    deal to get you to mainline tequila. You 
                    don't seem like the type.
          
                                 KAT
                           (holding up a 
                           drunken head)
                    Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can 
                    be "cool"?  You don't think I can be 
                    "laid back" like everyone else?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (slightly 
                           sarcastic)
                    I thought you were above all that
          
                                 KAT
                    You know what they say
          
          He stops the swing
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No. What do they say?
          
          Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Shit!
          
          He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up 
                    damn it!
          
          He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag 
          doll.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Kat! Wake up!  
          
                                 KAT
                           (waking)
                    What?
          
          He sighs with relief.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you were...
          
          They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES 
          on his shoes.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a 
          big swig.
          
          A KNOCK sounds at the door
          
                                 KAT
                    Go away
          
          Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the 
          smuggest of all possible grins.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Dinner taste better on the way out?
          
          Gives her a "don't even start" look.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I don't get you.  You act like you're 
                    too good for any of this, and then you 
                    go totally apeshit when you get here.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're welcome.
          
          She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.
          
          KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kat's in the driver's seat.  Patrick leans in and takes the 
          keys out of the ignition.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cute
          
          BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Kids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside 
          Joey catches up to them.
          
                                 JOEY
                    A bunch of us are going to Jaret's 
                    house.  Wanna come?
          
          Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.  
          She looks at her watch.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have to be home in twenty minutes.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (eagerly, to Joey)
                    I don't have to be home 'til two.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Then, c'mon.
                           (to Bianca)
                    Maybe next time --
          
          They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca
          
          Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca 
          standing alone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (slightly 
                           accusatory)
                    Have fun tonight?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Tons
          
          He starts to walk on
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Cameron?
          
          He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Do you think you could give me a ride 
                    home?
          
          INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling 
          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and 
          Patrick quickly changes it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm driving, so I get to pick the 
                    tunes.
          
          She changes it back to her song.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's my car.
          
          He changes it back.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    And I'm in control of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like 
                    them.  I saw you there.
          
          Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her 
          listen to her song.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    When you were gone last year -- where 
                    were you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Busy
          
                                 KAT
                    Were you in jail?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Maybe.
          
                                 KAT
                    No, you weren't
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then why'd you ask?
          
                                 KAT
                    Why'd you lie?
          
          He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the 
          music.  She bobs her head drunkenly.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I should do this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 KAT
                    This.
          
          She points to the radio
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Start a band?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (sarcastically)
                    My father wouldn't approve of that that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You don't strike me as the type that 
                    would ask permission.
          
          She turns to look at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, so now you think you know me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm gettin' there
          
          Her voice loses it's venom
          
                                 KAT
                    The only thing people know about me is 
                    that I'm "scary".
          
          He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary 
          right now.  He tries to hide his smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.
          
          They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, 
          realizing they're both created the same exterior for 
          themselves.
          
          Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He 
          looks up at her house.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    So what ' s up with your dad?  He a 
                    pain in the ass?
          
                                 KAT
                    He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Who?
          
                                 KAT
                                 BIANCA
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No offense, but you're sister is 
                    without.  I know everyone likes her and 
                    all, but ...
          
          Kat stares at him with new admiration.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know -- you're not as vile as I 
                    thought you were.
          
          She leans drunkenly toward him.
          
          Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then 
          Patrick turns away
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So, I'll see you in school
          
          Kat stares at him, pissed.  Then gets out of the car, 
          SLAMMING the door shut behind her.
          
          CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
          He finally breaks it.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I looked for you back at the party, but 
                    you always seemed to be "occupied".
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (faux-innocence )
                    I was?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You never wanted to go out with 'me, 
                    did you?
          
          Bianca bites her lip.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (reluctant)
                    Well, no...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Then that's all you had to say.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You always been this selfish?
          
          BIANCA thinks a minute
          
          He pulls up in front of the house
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Just because you're beautiful, doesn't 
                    mean you can treat people like they 
                    don't matter.
          
          She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and 
          gives him a kiss on the lips.  He draws back in surprise, 
          then kisses her back.  She smiles, then gets out of the car 
          without another word.
          
          Cameron grins and drives away
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    And I'm back in the saddle.
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the 
          others enter.  The White Rastas are first.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of 
                    my heart.
          
          He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
          
          CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found 
          friendliness.
          
                                 CLEM
                    Yippe kai-aye, bra. 
                           (to Kat)
                    Dance for me, cowgirl.
          
          He sits next to Derek
          
                                 CLEM 
                           (continuing)
                    Okay, now tell me again why he didn't 
                    shoot the deputy?
          
                                 DEREK
                    Because the deputy meant him no harm, 
                    my friend.  It was only the sheriff that 
                    was the oppressor.
          
          Joey saunters in and takes his seat.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Kat, babe, you were on fire.
          
          Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well now, did everyone have a good 
                    weekend?

                    Maybe we should ask Verona
          
          Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk.  Kat looks up, 
          down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.
          
          Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk 
          about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Okay then.  Well.
                           (beat)
                    Oh, yes
          
          She clears her throat.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    I'd like you all to write your own 
                    version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.

                    Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, 
                    whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate 
                    on his theme, however. Let's read it 
                    aloud, shall we? Anyone?
          
          The class is frozen in apathy.

                    Derek?
          
          Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in 
          his seat. Then grins.

                    In faith, I do not love thee with mine 
                    eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors

                    Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom 
                    pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as 
                    a laxative on my person.

                    You went to the party?  I thought we 
                    were officially opposed to suburban 
                    social activity.

                    I didn't have a choice.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat 
                    and what have you done with her?
          
                                 KAT
                    I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

                    I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.  
                    It was big fun.
          
          Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat 
          and smiles.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          She gathers her things and bolts out the door.  Patrick 
          looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.

                    So you got cozy with she who stings?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that 
                    I'm about to lose.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What'd you do to her?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I don ' t know. 
                           (beat)
                    I decided not to nail her when she was 
                    too drunk to remember it.
          
          Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then 
          turn back to Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          No shit.  She won't even look at me
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?
          
          Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility. 
          Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.

          Mandella is at her locker.  Drawings of William Shakespeare 
          adorn the door.  She looks at them with a sigh, then ties 
          her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut 
          off her air supply.
          
          Michael walks up.
          
                                 MICHAEL

                    Yeah.  I guess.
          
          MICHAEL rocks.  Very hip.

                    Oh yeah.
          
          She looks at him suspiciously
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who could refrain that had a heart to 
                    love and in that heart, courage to make 
                    ' B love known?
          
          Michael thinks for a minute.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Macbeth, right?

                           (happily stunned)
                    Right.

                                 PATRICK
                    Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine 
                    Mystique?  I lost my copy.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (frowning)
                    What are you doing here?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I heard there was a poetry reading.
          
                                 KAT
                    You 're so --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Pleasant?
          
          Kat stares at him, deadpan.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Wholesome.
          
                                 KAT
                    Unwelcome.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has 
                    her panties in a twist.
          
                                 KAT
                    Don't for one minute think that you had 
                    any effect whatsoever on my panties.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what did I have an effect on ?
          
                                 KAT
                    Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
          
          She pushes past him and heads out the' door
          Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand:  
          Taming of the Shrew.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Cameron  and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into 
          mouth.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You were right. She's still pissed.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Sweet love, renew thy force!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. 
                    People can hear you.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (exasperated)
                    You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice  
                    yourself on the altar of dignity and  
                    even the score.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Best case scenario, you're back on the 
                    payroll for awhile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's the worst?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You get the girl.
          
          Patrick  thinks for a minute
          
                                 PATRICK
                    If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz 
          Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.
          
          From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. 
          Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
          
          The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".  Being sung by Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    "This morning, I woke up with this 
                    feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, 
                    and so I just decided to myself--"
          
          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands 
          beneath the window, crooning.
          
          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and 
          doing backup vocal s.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    "I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk 
                    about it.  And didn't I go and shout it 
                    when you walked into the room --"
          
          He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
          
          IN THE CLASSROOM
          
          Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. 
          Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big 
          finale.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    " I think I love you I "
          
          INSIDE
          
          The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, 
          mortified, but with a slight smile
          
          INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling 
          over their misfortune.
          
                                 MISCREANT 
                    Nice song, Verona.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Flog me.
          
          He makes the appropriate hand gesture
          
          Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, 
          ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
          
                                 KAT (0. S.)
                    Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
          
          Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat 
          standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little.
          
          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He 
          turns fully to face her.
          
                                 KAT
                    Sir, I'd like to state for the record 
                    that Mr. Verona ' s current 
                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never 
                    filed a complaint.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You didn't have to.  He disrupted a 
                    classroom.
          
          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the 
          window.
          
          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.
          
          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."
          
          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window.
          
          The other miscreants watch with glee.
          
                                 KAT
                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.
          
          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy 
          about it, considering they're on the second floor.
          
          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. 
                    Rules stick.
          
          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something 
                    I've always wanted to show you.
          
          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.
          
          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make 
          the jump.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    These.
          
          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
          
          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the 
          flash of skin.
          
          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.  
                    But if I catch you doing that again, 
                    you'll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys.
          
          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without 
          noticing Patrick's absence.
          
          Kat smiles at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
          
          Kat bolts out the door.  Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle 
          mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN
          
          Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing 
          no one.
          
                                 KAT
                    He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he 
                    cruised on me.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    Look up, sunshine
          
          She does.  He's still in the tree
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I guess I never told you I'm afraid of 
                    heights.
          
                                 KAT
                           (smiling)
                    C'mon.  It's not that bad
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Try lookin' at it from this angle
          
          She assesses the branch structure
          
                                 KAT
                    Put your right foot there --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
          
                                 KAT
                    You want me to climb up and show you 
                    how to get down?
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (voice trembling)
                    Maybe.
          
          She sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she 
          perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her.
          
          Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a 
          monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been 
          duped.
          
                                 KAT
                    You shit!
          
          She climbs down after him
          
          EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY 
          
          Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
          
                                 KAT
                    The Partridge Family?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I figured it had to be something 
                    ridiculous to win your respect.  And 
                    piss you off.
          
                                 KAT
                    Good call.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So how'd you get Chapin to look the 
                    other way?
          
                                 KAT
                    I dazzled him with my wit
          
          She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at 
          giggling hyenas and wails on it.  The barker hands her a 
          stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID 
          next to her and they continue walking.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    A soft side? Who knew?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, well, don't let it get out
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what's your excuse?
          
                                 KAT
                    Acting the way we do.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yes
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't like to do what people expect.  
                    Then they expect it all the time and 
                    they get disappointed when you change.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So if you disappoint them from the 
                    start, you're covered?
          
                                 KAT
                    Something like that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then you screwed up
          
                                 KAT
                    How?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You never disappointed me.
          
          She blushes under his gaze
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You up for it?
          
                                 KAT
                    For. . . ?
          
          He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins 
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          
          The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, 
          stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
          
          Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
          Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
          
          Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of 
          her face.
          
          Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
          shots, they're both covered in paint
          
          She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
          empty.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Damn it!
          
          Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.  They land, 
          laughing.
          
          It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
          are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
          find each other's eyes.
          
          He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he 
          goes to kiss her.

          His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has 
          turned into a passionate kiss
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway.  Their paint wardrobe 
          has dried by now and they look like refugees from some 
          strange, yet colorful, war.
          
                                 KAT
                    State trooper?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fallacy.
          
                                 KAT
                    The duck?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hearsay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know the porn career's a lie.
          
          He shuts off the car and turns to her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do you?
          
          He kisses her neck.  It tickles.  She laughs.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tell me something true.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I hate peas.
          
                                 KAT
                    No -- something real.  Something no one 
                    else knows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (in-between kisses)
                    You're sweet.  And sexy.  And 
                    completely hot for me.
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No one else knows
          
                                 KAT
                    You're amazingly self-assured. Has 
                    anyone ever told you that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Go to the prom with me
          
          Kat's smile disappears.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that a request or a command?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know what I mean
          
                                 KAT
                    No.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No what?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, I won't go with you
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Why not?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because I don't want to. It's a stupid 
                    tradition.
          
          Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he 
          being paid to take her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    People won't expect you to go...
          
          Kat turns to him, getting angry.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                                 KAT
                    All of it -- what's in it for you?
          
          He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her 
          suspicions.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Create a little drama?  Start a new 
                    rumor?  What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So I have to have a motive to be with 
                    you?
          
                                 KAT
                    You tell me.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told 
                    you that?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (quietly)
                    Answer the question, Patrick
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (angry)
                    Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me.  
                    Just the pleasure of your company.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.  She breaks it in half before she 
          SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
          
          Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front 
          door and watches him go
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
          
          He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who 
          has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
          
          Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey 
          gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    cover that up
          
          The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face 
          Bianca TAPS on the open door.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Quick question -- are you going to the 
                    prom?
          
          Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM
          
          INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby.  She 
          fingers a strand of her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Then Guillermo says, "If you go any 
                    lighter, you're gonna look like an extra 
                    on 90210."
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No...
          
          Bianca stares at him for a moment.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    do you listen to this crap?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What crap?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm 
                    like, boring myself.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thank God!  If I had to hear one more 
                    story about your coiffure...
          
          He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and 
          smacks his hand away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    I figured you'd get to the good stuff 
                    eventually.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What good stuff?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The "real you".
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like my fear of wearing pastels?
          
          He looks stricken.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I'm kidding. 
                           (beat)
                    You know how sometimes you just become 
                    this "persona"?  And you don't know how 
                    to quit?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (matter of fact)
                    No
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how 
                    to lie.

          Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.  Finally, it 
          opens.
          
          Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th 
          Century.  Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
          
          INSERT - "0 FAIR ONE.  JOIN ME AT THE PROM.  I WILL BE 
          WAITING.  LOVE, WILLIAM S."
          
          Mandella's agog.  Trevor walks by and sees her holding the 
          dress.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're gonna look splendiferous in 
                    that, Mandella.
          
          Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                           (continuing)
                    that's cool to say.

                                 SHARON
                    Would you rather be ravished by a 
                    pirate or a British rear admiral?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Pirate -- no question.

                    Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with 
                    you. It's tomorrow night --
          
                                 WALTER
                    The prom?  Kat has a date?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, but
          
                                 WALTER
                    It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s 
                    who you want me to bend my rules for?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that 
                    is.
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're not going unless your sister 
                    goes.  End of story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my 
                    own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a 
                    possession!
          
          Bianca storms out.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (calling out)
                    You know what happens at proms?
          
          Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
          
                                 SHARON
                    They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll 
                    come home.  Let her go.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Kissing?  Is that what you think 
                    happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up 
                    to my elbows in placenta all day.

          BIANCA
          Come in.
          
          Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.

                           (kindly)
                    Listen, I know you hate having to sit 
                    home because I'm not Susie High School.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like you care.
          
                                 KAT
                    I do care. But I'm a firm believer in 
                    doing something for your own reasons, 
                    not someone else ' s .
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only 
                    sophomore that got asked to the prom and 
                    I can't go, because you won ' t.
          
          Kat clears her throat
          
                                 KAT
                    Joey never told you we went out, did 
                    he?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    In 9th.  For a month
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (confused)
                    Why?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (self-mocking)
                    He was, like, a total babe
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But you hate Joey
          
                                 KAT
                    Now I do.  Back then, was a different 
                    story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    As in...
          
          Kat takes a deep breath.
          
                                 KAT
                    He said everyone was doing it.  So I 
                    did it.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did what?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing on)
                    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I 
                    didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.  
                    He got pissed.  Then he broke up with 
                    me.
          
          Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 KAT
                    After that, I swore I'd never do 
                    anything just because "everyone else" 
                    was doing it.  And I haven't since. 
                    Except for Bogey's party, and my 
                    stunning gastro-intestinal display --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (stunned)
                    Why didn't you tell me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I wanted to let you make up your own 
                    mind about him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No. you didn't!  If you really thought 
                    I could make my own decisions, you 
                    would've let me go out with him instead 
                    of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
          
          Kat stands up slowly
          
                                 KAT
                    That's not
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'm not stupid enough to repeat your 
                    mistakes.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I thought I was protecting you.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    God, you're just like him! Just keep me 
                    locked away in the dark, so I can't 
                    experience anything for myself
          
                                 KAT
                    Not all experiences are good, Bianca. 
                    You can't always trust the people you 
                    want to.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I guess I'll never know, will I?
          
          She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it 
          behind her.
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
          
          A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  She rolls over and 
          picks up the phone.
          
          BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while 
          watching "I Love Lucy" reruns.
          
          A KNOCK sounds
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Come in.
          
          Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
          
                                 KAT
                    Feel like shopping?
          
          Bianca looks up, hopefully.
          
          LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.  Walter 
          has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What do you wanna watch?  We've got 
                    crap, crap, crap or crap
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Dr. Ruth?
          
          Bianca walks into the living room.  She's wearing a prom 
          dress.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi, Mommy.
                           (looking away)
                                 WALTER
          
          Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca 
          to Sharon.
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Honey, you look beautiful!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You like?  My date should be here in 
                    five.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm missing something.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a 
                    captain of oppression like some men we 
                    know.
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS.  Bianca runs to open it.  There stands 
          CAMERON.  He takes in Bianca's outfit.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Wow
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let's go.
          
          Walter rises.  Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
          
                                 SHARON 
                           (to Bianca)
                    Have a great time, honey!
          
                                 WALTER
                    But -- who -- what --?
          
          The door SLAMS.  As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a 
          blur rushes down the stairs and out the door.  The blur has 
          Kat ' s voice.
          
                                 KAT
                    Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See 
                    you in a few.
          
          The door SLAMS again.  Walter and Sharon 'are alone
          
                                 WALTER
                    What just happened?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Your daughters went to the prom.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Did I have anything to say about it?
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Absolutely not.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That ' s what I thought
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on 
          the porch, wearing a tux.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    I'm here to pick up Bianca.
          
                                 WALTER
                    late
          
          He SLAMS the door shut
          
          EXT  HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
          
          Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice 
          gown.
          
          Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.  In a tux.
          
                                 KAT
                    How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted.  
                    Where'd you get the dress?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just something I had.  You know
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Oh huh
          
                                 KAT
                    Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I 
                    questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
          
          Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No prob.
          
          He remains seated.  Kat fidgets nervously.
          
                                 KAT
                    are you ready?
          
          He rises and stares at her, taking in her image 
          appreciatively.  She blushes and turns away.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    C'mon.  Let's get this over with.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.  Patrick 
          and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Quite the ostentatious display
          
          A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Look, Clem even wore his good boots
          
          Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and 
          Bianca dancing cheek to cheek.  She smiles.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, 
          hair piled on top of her head.  She spots Kat and hurries 
          over.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Have you seen him?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William - he asked me to meet him here.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' 
                    progressed to full-on hallucinations.
          
          Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.  She turns and 
          points Mandella the same way.
          
          Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on 
          his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella's grin couldn't 
          be bigger.
          
          Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand 
          and leading her onto the dance floor.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Mi' lady.
          
                           (to Patrick)
                    Good sir.
          
          Patrick rolls his eyes.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT - LATER
          
          Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG.  Whatever he's 
          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.
          
          Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She 
          whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room
          
          INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a 
          stall.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (surprised)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    You think you ' re the only sophomore 
                    at the prom?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I did.
          
          Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    And just so you know, my date isn't 
                    planning on spending most of the night 
                    in his backseat.
          
          BIANCA What're you talking about?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - 
                    your cherry. He practically made a 
                    public announcement.
          
          Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity  tries to backpedal.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (continuing)
                    I wanted to tell you
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few 
          stray jocks - also dateless.  He zeroes in on Cameron, now 
          consoling a pissed-off Bianca.
          
          Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the 
          evil about to erupt.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    My grandmother's .
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    That's where I was last year.  She'd 
                    never lived alone -- my grandfather died 
                    -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, 
                    I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've 
                    never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent 
                    a year sitting next to my grandma on the 
                    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of 
                    story.
          
          He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat 
          stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh
          
                                 KAT
                    That ' s completely adorable!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It gets worse -- you still have your 
                    freshman yearbook?
          
          He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's Bianca doing here with that 
                    cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let 
                    some little punk ass snake me.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to 
          Cameron and Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Feces hitting fan.  C'mon
          
          Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca 
          staring after them.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt 
          Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this 
          situation.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it 
                    easy.
          
          Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.
          
          JOEY You two are in big trouble
          
          Cameron faces Joey.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.
          
          Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise 
          Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
          
          The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon 
          surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White 
          Rastas.
          
                                 DEREK 
                    Very uncool, my brother
          
                                 JOEY
                    I'm not your brother, white boy.
          
          The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that 
          they're white.
          
          Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Just so you know -- she'll only spread 
                    her legs once.
          
          Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing. 
          Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. 
          It's Bianca.  And she BELTS the hell out of him
          
                                 BIANCA
                    That's for making my date bleed
          
          She BELTS him again
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    That's for my sister.
          
          And AGAIN
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    And that's for me.
          
          Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.
          
                                 COWBOY
                    And that's for the fourth grade, 
                    asshole.
          
          HOTEL - NIGHT 
          
          KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Wait I...
          
                                 KAT
                    You were paid to take me out!  By -- 
                    the one person I truly hate.  I knew it 
                    was a set-up!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It wasn't like that.
          
                                 KAT
                    Really?  What was it like?  A down 
                    payment now, then a bonus for sleeping 
                    with me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I didn't care about the money.
          
          He catches up to her now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I cared about --
          
          She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than 
          in anger.
          
                                 KAT
                    You are so not what I thought you were.
          
          He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, 
          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.
          
          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She's 
          never looked more guilty.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a 
          blanket, watching "Sixteen Candles".  When Molly Ringwald 
          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream 
          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an 
          infomercial
          
          The phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes 
          in, bearing a cup of tea.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Are you sure you don't want to come 
                    with us?  It'll be fun.
          
          Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
          
                                 KAT
                    I ' m sure .
          
          Bianca sits down next to her
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You looked beautiful last night, you 
                    know.
          
                                 KAT
                    So did you
          
          Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL 
          rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his 
          head inside.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She okay?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I hope so.
          
          The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Was that your sister?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big 
                    ones.  Full of sperm.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Funny.
          
          Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the 
          infomercial with Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I don't understand the allure of 
                    dehydrated food.  Is this something I 
                    should be hip to?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, Daddy.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (dreading the 
                           answer)
                    So tell me about this dance. Was it 
                    fun?
          
                                 KAT
                    Parts of it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Which parts?
          
                                 KAT
                    The part where Bianca beat the hell out 
                    of some guy.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Bianca did what?
          
                                 KAT
                    What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed 
                    off on her?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No -- impressed.
          
          Kat looks up in surprise.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    You know, fathers don't like to admit 
                    that their daughters are capable of 
                    running their own lives.  It means we've 
                    become spectators.  Bianca still lets me 
                    play a few innings.  You've had me on 
                    the bleachers for years.  When you go to 
                    Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to 
                    watch the game.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (hopeful)
                    When I go?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've 
                    changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a 
                    check.
          
          Kat reaches over and gives him a hug
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes 
          from the food line.
          
                                 CAMERON (0. S.)
                    Katarina?
          
          She turns and looks at him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'd like to express my apologies.
          
                                 KAT
                    For what?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    I didn't mean for you to get -- When 
                    Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, 
                    I had no idea it would turn out so -- 
                    ugly. I would never have  done anything 
                    to compromise your - - -
          
          He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray 
          against the wall and marched off -- the old "kill, kill" 
          look back in her eyes.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace
          
          CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open 
          book in hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Who can tell me at what point Lucentio 
                    admits his deception?
          
          The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks 
          in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward 
          the hallway.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (to the teacher)

          HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair 
          between two rows of lockers.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let go!

                    You set me up.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I just wanted --
          
                                 KAT
                    What? To completely damage me?  To send 
                    me to therapy forever? What?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No! I just wanted
          
          Miss Perky walks up
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my 
                    office?
          
          INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, 
          then focuses on Bianca.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    So you're the real bitch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch.  
                    I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I 
                    could.  Apparently, this makes me a 
                    horrible person.  I'm sorry.
          
          She turns to Kat.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I swear -- I didn't know about the 
                    money.  I didn't even know Joey was 
                    involved.  I would never intentionally 
                    hurt you, Kat.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Kat)
                    Do you care to respond?
          
                                 KAT
                    Am I supposed to feel better? Like, 
                    right now?  Or do I have some time to 
                    think about it?
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    Just smack her now.
          
          Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (to Miss Perky)
                    We'll be getting back to you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    What, no hug?
          
          HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or 
                    is it just me?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just you.
          
          ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
          
          Mrs. Blaise faces the class
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    All right.  I'm assuming everyone found 
                    time to compose, their poems. Except for 
                    Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.
          
          Nerds in the back high-five each other.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
          
          No one moves.  Then Kat slowly stands up.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'11 go
          
          Patrick looks up.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Oh, Lord.
          
          She downs a couple Prozac
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Please proceed.
          
          Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath 
          before reading from her notebook.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate the way you talk to me/ and the 
                    way you cut your hair/ I hate the way 
                    you drive my car/ I hate it when you 
                    stare.
          
          She pauses, then continues
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and 
                    the way you read my mind/ I hate you so 
                    much it makes me sick/ it even makes me 
                    rhyme.
          
          She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who 
          stares at the floor.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate the way you're always right/ I 
                    hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you 
                    make me laugh/ even worse when you make 
                    me cry/ I hate it that you're not 
                    around/ and the fact that you didn't 
                    call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ' 
                    t hate you/ not even close, not even a 
                    little bit, not even any at all.
          
          She looks directly at Patrick.  He looks back this time.  
          The look they exchange says everything.
          
          Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains 
          in stunned silence.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's 
          greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the 
          front seat.
          
          She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins 
          around.
          
          Patrick stands there, smiling.
          
                                 KAT
                    A Fender Strat. You bought this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you could use it. When you 
                    start your band.
          
          She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Besides, I had some extra cash. Some 
                    asshole paid me to take out a really 
                    great girl.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that right?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for 
                    her.
          
          Blushes and looks down.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You know -- it's not every day you find 
                    a girl who'll flash her tits to get you 
                    out of detention.
          
          Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
          
          He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does 
          She lets him this time.
          
          Then breaks it off
          
                                 KAT
                    You can't just buy me a guitar every 
                    time you screw up, you know.
          
          He grimaces.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know
          
          He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
          
                                 KAT
                    And don't just think you can
          
          He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET
          
          We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET
          
          Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers.  Kat 
          watches.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why is my veggie burger the only burnt 
                    object on this grill?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because I like to torture you.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman 
                    yearbook?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Don ' t you even dare. . .
          
          ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They do to!

                    Can someone please tell her that 
                    sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?
          
          ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
          
          Severely making-out in a lawn chair.  She comes up for a 
          breath.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    I can't remember a word of Shakespeare 
                    right now. Isn't that weird?
          
          Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND 
          PATRICK
          
          She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca 
          now hands her.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're freaked over this, aren't you?
          
          Bianca hands her the yearbook
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's more than freaked.  He's froke
          
          Flips to a page.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'd like to call your attention to 
                    Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look

          She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes 
          and throws a handful of pretzels at her.

          Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --  as we

EXT. STREET - DAY

A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a 
package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.

UPS MAN
 

Good morning, UPS!

He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.

UPS MAN
 

UPS, good to see you!

He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely 
around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.

UPS MAN
 

Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front 
steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package 
behind him and back down the steps.

He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Several people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the 
package... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.

INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY

ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts 
kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of 
APARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.

We hear a small dog barking.

GRUFF MAN (O.S.)
 

Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.

GRUFF MAN
 

What do you want?

UPS MAN
 

UPS, sir. And how are you this
afternoon? Alrighty then!

The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A 
small Shiatsu stands beside him.

UPS MAN
 

I have a package for you.

The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The 
man takes the package.

GRUFF MAN
 

It sounds broken.

UPS MAN
 

Most likely sir! I bet it was
something nice though! Now... I
haver an insurance form. If you'll
just sign here, here, and here,
and initial here, and print your name
here, we'll get the rest of the
forms out to you as soon as we
can.

The man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see 
that he likes the UPS guy.

UPS MAN
 

That's a lovely dog you have. Do
you mind if I pet him, sir?

GRUFF MAN

(mumbles)
 

I don't give a rat's ass.

The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.

UPS MAN
 

Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!

GRUFF MAN

(under breath)
 

Brother.

Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.

UPS MAN
 

That's fine sir. I can fill out
the rest. You just have yourself
a good day. Take care, now! 'Bye
'bye, then!

THRASH MUSIC STARTS

INT. HALLWAY -- CONT'D

The UPS Man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well.

INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D

The Gruff Man shakes the box, tosses it down and sits in front of the TV.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT'D

The UPS Man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly. He passes 
several people.

UPS MAN

(quickly)
 

UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin'
through.

INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D

We see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. 
The Gruff Man looks over.

GRUFF MAN
 

Hey, stupid! Get away from the
door!

The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.

GRUFF MAN
 

What's the matter with you, I said
GIT!!!

He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a 
stuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, "You have been had by Ace Ventura - 
Pet Detective." He breathes fire.

GRUFF MAN
 

Son of a bitch!

He smashes the dog to the ground.

EXT. ALLEY - CONT'D

As the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head 
sticks out. Ace is gloating.

ACE

(announcer's voice)
 

That was a close one, ladies and
gentlemen. Unfortunately, in
every contest, there must be...
A LOOSER!

He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.

ACE (CONT'D)
 

LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!

He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.

He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.

ACE

(to dog)
 

No problem, it gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.

Ace sits back. SMASH!!!

From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.

ACE
 

Or, we could try it now.

Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit 
out of it.

ACE
 

Oooh, boy.

ACE'S POV

We see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.

ACE
 

Warning! Assholes are closer than
they appear!

The dog is barking insanely.

ACE

(to dog)
 

You think you can do better?!

The baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.

ACE
 

Wanna give me a push while you're
back there?

BOOM! The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices.

ACE
 

FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!!

Ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.

EXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY

Ace and his new pal speed away freely.

Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield 
to Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.

The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: "Reward" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's 
seat.

THRASH MUSIC ENDS

INT. HOUSE - DAY

A very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.

WOMAN
 

My little baby. You missed mommy
didn't you? Did daddy hurt you?
I won't let him, no I won't. He
may have kept the big screen TV,
but he's not gonna keep my baby.
No he isn't.

(very sexy to Ace)
 

Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can I
ever repay you?

She slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck.

ACE
 

Well, the reward would be good,
and there was some damage to my –

She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss.

WOMAN
 

Would you like me to take you
pants off instead?

ACE
 

Ummmm… Sure.

She pulls him toward the bedroom.

WOMAN
 

It takes a big man to stand up to
my husband. He's already put two
of my lovers in the hospital.

ACE
 

How did he find out? Does he have
you followed.

WOMAN
 

No… I tell him

She plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed.

EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY

The stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are 
practicing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.

Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is 
practicing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.

TRAINER
Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!

Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone 
dance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.

The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake "kicks" a perfect field goal. The 
Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT

The stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.

Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.

The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.

They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.

Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly 
takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.

Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its 
job. Snowflake quickly goes limp.

Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle 
has turned into a painful whimper.

The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free 
himself.

INT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY

Close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE 
ROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in 
a bag to JENNIFER,  a very sweet nine year old.

ADELLE
 

Here you go, honey. Now
remember… this kind of fish
doesn't like it in the freezer.

JENNY
 

But what's gonna happen to Dolly?

ADELLE
 

Don't worry, I'll make sure she
gets a proper burial.

Jennifer exits. Adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. The cat catches it in mid-air.

ADELLE
 

Rest in peace.

Ace enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes.

ADELLE
 

Well… here comes another dead
fish.

ACE
 

Hi, beautiful. What time do you
get off?

ADELLE
 

Uh oh.

ACE

(suggestively)
 

I've heard some pretty great
things about your kibble.

ADELLE
 

Well, I hope I'm not getting a
reputation.

ACE

(switching to mock anger)
 

Just get me the food!

She chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food.

ADELLE
 

So… ahh, when can I expect you
to pay your tab?

ACE
 

I'm a little bit Sli  Pickins,
right now, I'm a little Tight
Squeeze Louise, a little Welfare
Wolly, Potless Pissing Pete, I'm
ah –

ADELLE
 

If you were a horse I'd shoot ya'.
Just take it.

ACE
 

Gravy! I'm good for it, Adelle.
I'm on a very big case right now.

Ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon.

ACE
 

See this pigeon? It's a true
albino. Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a ten thousand
dollar reward.

ADELLE
 

Wow, albino pigeons are very
rare. How are you going to find
him?

ACE
 

Just keep my eyes open, and hope
to god it doesn't snow.

Ace grabs his bags and heads for the door.

ADELLE
 

You're a good boy, Ace. A good
boy.

He holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. The gentleman 
is walking a toy poodle on a leash. The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the 
floor. Ace and Adelle just stare.

ELDERLY MAN

(in a loud voice)
 

Do you have anything for ringworm?

EXT. SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

Ace enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a 
crappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. 
SHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the 
door and up the stairs.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAY

Ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. Ace is startled by 
the dreaded 'Shickadance Rasp' (not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST).

LANDLORD
 

Venturaaaaa?

Ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around.

ACE
 

Yes, Satan?

Now Ace turns around in mock surprise.

ACE
 

Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You sounded
like someone else.

LANDLORD
 

Never mind the wise cracks
Venturaaa. You owe me rent!

ACE
 

Mr. Shickadance… I told you,
you're my first priority! As soon
as I find the white pigeon,
you're paid!!

LANDLORD
 

I heard animals in there Ventura!
I heard 'em again this morning,
scratchin' around.

ACE
 

I never bring my work home with
me, sir.

The landlord notices the bags of kibble.

LANDLORD
 

Oh, yeah? What's all this pet
food for?

ACE

(beat)
 

Fiber.

The landlord isn't buying it.

ACE
 

You wanna take a look for
yourself? Go head.

Ace rattles his keys in the door. Then he swings it open and turns on the light. The house is clear. 
Ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.

ACE
 

Well… are you satisfied?

LANDLORD

(still suspicious)
 

Yeah, but don't ever let me catch
you with an animal in there,
that's all!

ACE
 

Okay then. Take care now. 'Bye
'bye.

The landlord walks away as Ace closes the door.

ACE

(quietly to himself)
 

LLOOSER.

He then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle.

CHAOS ENSUES! Animals jump out from every direction. Lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly 
through the air, all of them gravitating to Ace.

ACE

(to his flock)
 

Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!

INT. MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAY

The very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE, owner of the Miami Dolphins. Riddle, 70, is a 
take charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER, 
an ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and MELISSA ROBINSON, Podacter's attractive assistant.

RIDDLE
 

I just want to know one thing; How
the hell do you lose a 500 pound
fish?!

Melissa's about to speak but hesitates.

RIDDLE (CONT.)
 

What?

MELISSA
 

It's not a fish, sir. It's a
mammal.

An angry Riddle stands up.

RIDDLE
 

Oh, thank you very much, Mrs.
Jacque Cousteau!

PODACTER
 

Bob, she didn't mean anything by
it.

RIDDLE calms down a little, and sits.

RIDDLE

(calmer)
 

Listen, personally, I don't give a
good god damn about a fish.

He looks at Melissa. She doesn't dare say anything.

RIDDLE (CONT.)
 

All I care about is winning this
Super Bowl! I want the players'
head in the right place. Shit,
Roger, you've been in this game
long enough, you know how
superstitious players are. Our
quarterback's been putting his
socks on backwards since high
school. And I got a lineman who
hasn't washed his jock in two
years because he thinks flies are
lucky! I want that god damn fish
on the field Super Bowl Sunday!
FIND THE FISH, OR FIND NEW JOBS!

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

An upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway.

PODACTER
 

Why did it have to happen now? I
got three stinking years left till
retirement.

MELISSA
 

I've got forty.

PODACTER
 

I'll tell you who did it. It was
those goddamn animal rights nuts!
Always out there with their
goddamn signs, ANIMALS WERE BORN
FREE, STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE!
That goddamn fish lives better than
they do!

They stop outside Melissa's office by her secretary's desk.

MELISSA
 

The police are checking into the
animal rights people.

(to secretary)
 

Martha, have the police called
back about the dolphin yet?

MARTHA
 

No, but I wanted to tell you, when
I lost my Cuddles, I hired a pet
detective.

PODACTER
 

A what?

MARTHA
 

A pet detective.

MELISSA
 

Thanks Martha, but we'd better
leave this to professionals.

MARTHA
 

Well actually, he was quite good.
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

CLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon. Widen to reveal, Ace precariously perched on the 
roof of a two story building. He is four feet away from "The" pigeon. Ater a beat, he makes a 
mad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird.

ACE
 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

The bird makes a clean getaway. Unable to stop his momentum, Ace flies past the edge of the 
building and slides down the side of the roof.

EXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTION

BAM!!! Ace crashes to the ground. As he lies face down, in a heap of trash, his beeper goes off.

EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS/BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

Parking lot. Ace's clunker drives by some real nice cars. Employees stare at him.

INT. SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY

A stern guard is admitting people into the stadium. He scans each one with a security detection 
wand.

MAN #1
 

Art Wheeler. Sporting supplies.

The guard scans him. He goes.

MAN #2
 

Tom Anderson. Concessions.

The guard scans him. He goes.

ACE
 

Ace Ventura. Pet detective.

The guard stares at Ace, accusingly.

INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY

Martha enters.

MARTHA
 

Ah… Mr. Ventura to see you.

MELISSA
 

Okay, send him in.

Martha exits, Ace enters.

MELISSA (CONT'D)
 

Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson. Did you
have any trouble getting in?

ACE
 

No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

MELISSA

(apologetically)
 

Super Bowl week. Security's
tight. Mr. Ventura, I'll get
right to the point…

She slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit.

MELISSA
 

Our mascot was stolen from his
tank last night. Are you familiar
with Snowflake?

The tape shows Snowflake doing a trick. The trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out 
signals.

TRAINER (ON TAPE)
Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!

Snowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of 
the pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer.

MELISSA (O.S.)
 

We got Snowflake from the Miami
Seaquarium. He's a rare Bottle
Nose Dolphin. That's the new
trick he was going to do during
the half-time show.

While Ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a 
neat little pile on her desk.

MELISSA
 

Would you like an ashtray?

ACE
 

No, I don't smoke.

He adds more shells to the pile.

Melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake.

MELISSA
 

To be honest, Mr. Ventura.
I'm pretty skeptical. Before
today, I didn't even know there
was such a thing as a pet
detective.

ACE
 

Well, now that you do, you'll know
who to call if your Schnauser ever
runs away.

MELISSA
 

How did you know I have a
Schnauser?

Ace pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her.

ACE
 

He's young, about five pounds,
black coat, white speckles…

(sniffs the hair)
 

…likes to chase cars.

MELISSA
 

Very impressive.

ACE
 

You should see what I can do with
a good stool sample.

MELISSA
 

I can hardly wait. Look, we've
got a problem. Can you help me or
not?

ACE

(coy)
 

Well, sea faring creatures aren't
really my expertise…

MELISSA
 

We'll give you three thousand
dollars on delivery.

Ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show.

ACE
 

The dolphin is a social creature.
Capable of complex communication.
Traveling in large groups or
schools…

EXT. PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATER

The Dolphin players practice. A crowd of reporters interview Marino.

MARINO
 

We just choked in 82. We had a
chance to win it and we didn't.
Nobody's gonna choke this time,
and if they do, I'll kill 'em.

Ace and Melissa head for Snowflake's tank.

MELISSA
 

The police were here this morning.
Apparently, the kidnappers used
the back gate.

Ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field.

MELISSA (CONT'D)
 

They said some kind of a –

ACE
 

Four wheel drive van… loaded from
the rear.

Ace sniffs the turf. Podacter enters nervously.

MELISSA
 

Oh, hi, Roger. How are you holding
up?

PODACTER
 

Well if it looks like I'm walking
funny it's because I have a bunch
on reporters up my ass. They've
been asking me about Snowflake all
day. Who's this?

MELISSA
 

Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.
Ace is our pet detective.

Podacter shakes his hand.

PODACTER
 

Nice to meet you. Martha Metz
recommended you very highly.

ACE
 

Martha Metz? Martha Metz. Oh
yeah, the bitch.

PODACTER
 

What?

ACE
 

Pekinese. Hyperactive. Lost in
Highland Park area. She was half
dead when I found her. Is that
the tank?

They both follow Ace as he makes a B-line.

EXT. SNOWFLAKE'S TANK - MOMENTS LATER

The tank is empty.

ACE
 

Cops drain it?

MELISSA
 

Yes. This morning.

Ace hops on the ladder.

ACE
 

If I'm not back in five
minutes… call Lloyd Bridges.

INT. DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATER

While eating sunflower seeds, Ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where 
the hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen. All the while, he is singing a 
bastardized version of the theme from, "Flipper."

ACE
 

…Wonderful Flipper… glorious
Flipper… magnificent
Flipper… The flippiest Flipper…

Podacter and Melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, "What have we gotten 
ourselves into?" Podacter spots something.

PODACTER
 

Oh, great.

A hoard or reporters are headed their way.

PODACTER (CONT)
 

I'll try to head them off.

MELISSA

(to Ace)
 

Get out of the tank.

ACE

(still singing)
 

…Can't hear you Flipper,
Flipper… Lookin' for Flipper,
gotta find Flipper…

MELISSA
 

I said, get out of the tank! Now!

The reporters draw closer. Podacter heads them off.

REPORTER
 

So where's Snowflake?

PODACTER
 

Ah… Snowflake is just, ah, not
available right now.

REPORTER
 

Come on, I'm supposed to get a
shot of his new trick for the
evening news.

REPORTER #2
 

What? Is he sick?

Other reporters chime in.

VARIOUS REPORTERS
Did something happen to
Snowflake?! What're you
hiding..?!

Melissa and Podacter don't know what to say. Then, a strange voice is heard.

ACE/HEINZ (O.S.)

(unrecognizable accent)
 

How cun I be getting dis vork dun
mit all da shouting? What for is
dis shouting?

REPORTER
 

Who the hell is that?

MELISSA
 

That? That's…

ACE/HEINZ
 

Heinz Kissvelvet. I am Trainer of
Dolphins. You vant to talk to ze
dolphin, you talk to me!

REPORTER
 

What happened to the regular
trainer?

ACE/HEINZ
 

Vy do you care about the dolphin?
Do you know him? Does he call you
at home? Do you have a dorsal
fin?

(beat)
 

To train ze dolphin, you must zink
like ze dolphin. You must be
getting oonside ze dolphin's head!
Just yesterday I'm asking
Snowflake… "ee, eee, eee." He
said, "Eee, eee, eee, eee." Und
you can quote him.

Ace spits at the reporters' feet. Podacter jumps in.

PODACTER
 

Gentlemen, please, Coach Shula's
press conference is just about to
begin. Why don't I take you over
there and let, ah, Heinz, do his
job.

He ushers the press away.

MELISSA

(sotto to Ace)
 

Are you finished, Heinz?

ACE
 

Not yet.

Ace goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents – mainly leaves, small 
twigs and gunk. He roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. He smiles to himself.

ACE
 

Now I'm finished.

EXT. METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

A flurry of activity in the detective division. As Ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by 
the obnoxious, SERGEANT AGUADO.

AGUADO
 

Hey, Ventura! Make any good
collars lately?

ANOTHER COP
Or were they leashes?

They all bust up. Aguado spots a bug on the ground.

AGUADO
 

Uh oh.

(steps on the bug)
 

Homicide, Ventura!

The cops are falling all over themselves laughing.

AGUADO
 

How you gonna solve this one?!

Ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.

ACE
 

Good question, Aguado… first I'd
establish a motive. In this case
the killer saw the size of the
bug's dick, and became insanely
jealous.

The other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". Aguado has no comeback. Ace comes face to face 
with him.

ACE
 

Then I'd lose thirty pounds
porking his wife.

Aguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace.

With a lightening move, Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado's face down next to the dead 
bug.

ACE
 

Now kiss and make up.

Ace walks off.

ACE

(to himself)
 

LLLOOOSER!

Ace walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ, a young energetic member of the homicide 
division. Ace has a silly impish look on his face.

ACE

(playfully)
 

I miss you.

EMILIO
 

It's not a good time, Ace. If
Einhorn sees me talking to you I'm
gonna be history.

ACE
 

Okay. Just tell me what you got
on Snowflake. That's all I need.

EMILIO
 

…I can't say anything. My hands
are tied.

ACE

(effeminate)

Sounds like my kind of a party.

A cop comes to Emilio's desk.

COP

Look alive, Einhorn's on her way
down.

EMILIO
 

Ace, please?!

ACE
 

Just tell me who's working the
case?

EMILIO
 

Aguado.

ACE
 

Aguado?! He's pimple juice! He's
the poster child for lead paint
chip eaters!

EMILIO
 

Look, Ace. We're a little busy
with murderers and drug dealers.
A missing dolphin isn't exactly a
high priority.

The elevator is getting closer.

EMILIO
 

Ace, gimme a break will ya?

Ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.

EMILIO

(quickly)
 

Okay, okay. We checked all the
local animal rights groups,
taxidermists, and we're running a
check through DMV on all recent
van rentals. So far, nada.

ACE
 

Any unusual bets being made?

EMILIO
 

Ace, it's the Super Bowl, of
course there's bets being made.

ACE
 

What'd you find out about the
tank?

EMILIO
 

Nothing weird. Just the tire
tracks and the exit route. The
guard didn't see anything.

ACE
 

That's it?

EMILIO
 

That's it. I swear. Now please
go away!

ACE
 

You know something?

(again impish)
 

YOU'RE NICE!

Ace gets up and exits the room. Then just as Emilio sighs with relief, Ace pops back in.

ACE
 

What about crazy Philly fans?

The elevator bell rings. Out steps police LT. LOIS EINHORN, mid 30s, with a slender build, a 
great pair of legs and a bad tude.

ACE
 

Holy Testicle Tuesday!

EINHORN

(to Emilio)
 

What the hell is he doing here?

ACE
 

I came to confess. I was the
second gunman on the grassy knoll.

EINHORN
 

Spare me the routine, Ventura. I
know you're working the Snowflake
case. May I suggest you yield to
the experts on this one? We'll
find the porpoise.

ACE

(mock relief)
 

Whewww… now I feel better!

Ace turns to go.

ACE (CONT)
 

Of course, that might not do any
good. You see, nobody's missing a
porpoise. It's a dolphin that's
been taken. The common Harbor
Porpoise has an abrupt snout,
pointed teeth, and a triangular
thorasic fin, while the Bottlenose
Dolphin, or Tursiops Truncatus,
has an elongated beak, round,
cone-shaped teeth, and a
distinctive serrated dorsal
appendage. (beat) But I'm sure
you already knew that. (beat)
That's what turns me on about you.
Hey… maybe I'll give you a call
sometime, lieutenant. Your number
still 911? Alrighty then!

Ace exits.

CUT TO:

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

A wild thrasher club. An incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. Kids jump wildly into the 
moshing pit.

Ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.

ACE

(shouting)
 

Excuse me?! Is Greg here?!

The burnout's head thrashes on. No acknowledgement of Ace.

ACE
 

Thank you!

Ace heads for the basement stairs.

INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT

Ace descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. Ace bangs on it three times. A voice is 
heard from inside.

VOICE (O.S.)
 

Password!

ACE
 

Tom Vu! I pay for sex! You can
too!

CLICK! The door electronically unlatches and slides open.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Ace enters. Green Peace "Save the Whales" posters abound. GREG/WOODSTOCK, a laid 
back, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. Ace and he have 
their own distinct banter.

A thud from above. Ace looks up.

ACE'S POV

Part of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. A guy's 
face gets smashed into the grate. We see that it is the burnout from the club.

ACE

(to burnout)
 

Found him!

WOODSTOCK
 

Hey! St. Francis! How's it goin?

ACE
 

Super, and thank you for asking.
Hope you're having a nice day.

WOODSTOCK
 

Do you?

ACE
 

Don't I? And what are you up to?

WOODSTOCK
 

Just watching the fishies, man.

There is a BLIP on the computer screen.

WOODSTOCK
 

Alright, you're just in time for
the party. You see those blips?

ACE
 

I certainly do.

ON THE SCREEN

A map with several ships on the ocean.

He quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.

WOODSTOCK
 

That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.
I'm sending them new directional
coordinates… They'll find Jimmy
Hoffa before they find any
Humpbacks.

ACE
 

Gravy.

Woodstock moves to a different screen.

WOODSTOCK
 

Check this out.

More computer graphics come up on the screen.

WOODSTOCK
 

Just changed the formula for
Purina's puppy chow.

(turns to Ace)
 

Too much filler, don't ya' think?

ACE

(acting turned on)
 

I'm very attracted to you right
now.

Woodstock chuckles.

WOODSTOCK
 

Are you?

ACE
 

Aren't I? Can you still tap into
all the aquatic supply store in
the area?

WOODSTOCK
 

Of course I can. Why?

ACE
 

I want to trace the sale of any
equipment for transporting or
housing a dolphin within the past
few months…

WOODSTOCK
 

C'mon, Ace. I thought you might
have a challenge for me…

Woodstock starts hacking away.

ACE
 

Okay then, try to remember the
sixties.

WOODSTOCK
 

Wow! God one! Let's see…
Marine winch sling, feeder fish,
20,000 gallon tank…

He waits. We hear a beep.

WOODSTOCK
 

That's it. I found the culprit.

ACE
 

Who is it?

WOODSTOCK

(dramatically)
 

…Sea World.

ACE
 

…bastard.

WOODSTOCK
 

Hang on, hang on…

(He taps a couple keys)
 

Well, what do we have here?
That's a lot of equipment for a
civilian.

The printer spits out some data. Woodstock rips off the page and hands it to Ace.

ACE
 

Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

WOODSTOCK
 

Billionaire and rare fish
collector.

ACE
 

RRREHEHEALLY!

A PICTURE OF CAMP

Comes up on the computer screen.

WOODSTOCK
 

That, my friend, is the face of
the enemy.

He pages through his file on screen.

WOODSTOCK
 

…Always tryin' to get his hands
on endangered species…

Newspaper articles fill the screen. One shows a picture of Camp and some Dolphin players.

ACE
 

Hold on, this guy's connected with
the Dolphins?

Ace leans in.

WOODSTOCK
 

Camp donated the land the new
stadium's built on.

(re: article)
 

Oh, look at this, he's throwin'
another, "I'm the richest man in
the universe" party.

ACE

(thinking)
 

Hmmm… I wonder if I can find
myself a date.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT

It's a magnificent home. There is an extremely formal party in progress. Twenty to thirty people 
having champagne, caviar, and hot air. We see Dan Marino sitting with an audience around him.

DAN
 

We just choked in 82. We had a
chance to win and we didn't. But
nobody's gonna choke this time; if
they do, I'll kill 'em!

Everybody laughs.

EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT

Ace and Melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to Camp's mansion.

MELISSA
 

I'm really going out on a limb
here, Ventura. Camp's social
events are strictly A-list.

ACE

(a la Love Connection)
 

'Well, Chuck… the date started
off good, but just before we got
to the party, she seemed to tense
up.'

Melissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker.

MELISSA
 

I swear, if you do anything to
embarrass me in front of Camp…

ACE
 

You mean like this?

Ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion. Just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like 
Gavin McCloud, opens the door. Ace doesn't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse.

ACE
 

Owwwe!!!

He sees the butler.

ACE
 

Oh, hi Captain Stubing.

Melissa storms in, already pissed.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - CONT

Ace and Melissa enter. Camp looks over.

CAMP
 

Melissa! Glad you could make it!
Oh, and who is this?

MELISSA
 

This is my date. He's a…
lawyer.

CAMP
 

Well, does he have a name, or
should I call him "Lawyer"?

MELISSA
 

I'm sorry, it's Ace - ah, Tom Ace.

Ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability. He jumps in.

ACE
 

Tom Ace. Wonderful to meet you,
Mr. Camp, and congratualtions on
all your success. You smell
terrific.

CAMP
 

Ah, well, thank you. Please, come
in.

Ace boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. Melissa closely follows.

MELISSA

(sotto)
 

This is insane. There's no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

ACE

(spreading pate' on a cracker)
 

Will you just keep him occupied,
while I work my magic please.

She crosses the room. He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. A man in a tux 
beside Ace spreads pate' on his own cracker.

ACE

(with a mouthful, to man)
 

Smooshy, isn't it?

Off the stuffy man's reaction…

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATER

Ace approaches Camp.

ACE
 

Excuse me, Ron, I need to use the
bathroom?

(palms his stomach, whispering loudly)
 

I think it's the pate'.

CAMP
 

Um, it's just over there.

ACE
 

Thanks. Stuff probably looks
better on the way out, huh?

Ace laughs, slaps Camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - CONT

Ace wastes no time. He locks the door, turns on the water faucet, steps onto the toilet seat, opens 
and climbs out a window.

EXT. MANSION COURT YARD - CONT

Ace drops to the ground. He follows a pathway, through a gazebo and into a doorway, all the time 
quietly singing the musical score to 'Mission Impossible'.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONT

Ace browses through a myriad of dramatically lit, salt water tanks, still singing. They're all filled 
with colorful exotic fish. Very impressive, but nothing large enough to house a dolphin. He 
continues on towards a large door.

INT. TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATER

A huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. Ace swings open the 
large door and enters.

ACE
 

Gravy.

Ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. The ladder leads to a 
narrow catwalk over the center of the water. Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks 
carefully out there.

CLOSE ON ACE. THIS IS IT.

He looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. Now he stops singing, quietly squats down and 
dangles the fish over the water.

ACE

(gently)
 

Snowflake… Here, Snowflake…
Snooowflaaaake…

A GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCH 
FROM ACE'S FACE!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, ACE IS A TAD SURPRISED.

He reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water.

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SAME TIME

Melissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish. Camp approaches.

CAMP
 

Wonderful, aren't they?

MELISSA

(nervously)
 

Yes. They're incredible.

CAMP
 

No matter what is going on in my
life, I can always watch them
swim and be completely at peace.

INT. INDOOR POOL ROOM - SAME TIME

The water is still for a moment. Then, Ace breaks the surface.

ACE

(frantic, to himself)
 

It's not Snowflake… It's not
Snowflake.

Instantly, Ace's body is thrashed around back and forth through the water, the entire length of the 
pool.

ACE

(screaming)
 

IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE!!! IT'S NOT
SNOWFLAAAA!!!

INT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER

A line is forming outside the bathroom. Camp and Melissa are seated nearby. He's getting curious.

CAMP
 

Are you sure he's okay? It's been
an awfu;;y long time.

MELISSA
 

Who, Tom? Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

Ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there, completely drenched from head to toe, 
with his pants in shreds. Everyone stops. They all stare at Ace in amazement.

ACE

(loudly to the entire room)
 

DO NOT GO IN THERE!

(fanning the air)
 

Whewww!!

EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER

Ace and Melissa are exiting. Camp stops in the doorway.

CAMP

(still confused)
 

I'm very sorry, Mr. Ace. I'll
have the pluming checked
immediately.

ACE
 

Be sure that you do. If I had
been drinking out of that toilet,
I might have been killed!

Ace shakes Camp's hand and notices his ring. He holds on to get a better look. It's a very distinct, 
commemorative ring.

Camp wants his hand back but Ace won't let go. Melissa finally drags Ace away.

MELISSA
 

We'd better go.

Camp looks on and shakes his head.

INT. MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHT

Ace is thinking. Melissa is pissed.

MELISSA
 

…Y'know, I don't even want to
know why your pants are missing!
I don't care what happened! You
could have cost me my job.

ACE

(on his own wavelength)
 

I was wrong about Camp. He's
breaking the law but he's not our
guy.

MELISSA
 

It's a sure thing! It's
definitely him! Just get me in
there! Let me work my magic!

Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely.

ACE
 

This is the key. Right here!

MELISSA
 

Hiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made!

ACE
 

So small! So unnoticeable! Yet
an invaluable piece… of our
twisted little jigsaw puzzle!

Melissa stares at Ace like he's gone crazy. There is a flash of headlights and a car horn. Melissa 
swerves back into her own lane. Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search 
for it frantically.

ACE
 

Damn it!

(to Melissa)
 

Try to keep it on the road.

INT. MELISSA'S LIVING ROOM

Melissa enters, followed by Ace.

MELISSA
 

So, you found a pebble in
Snowflake's tank. Excuse me while
I call CNN.

ACE
 

I found it in the filter. And
it's not a pebble. It is a rare,
triangular cut, orange amber.

Ace hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases.

MELISSA
 

What are you talking about?

ACE
 

Tonight I saw the exact same stone
in Camp's ring.

Ace finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it.

MELISSA
 

I thought you said he didn't do
it.

ACE
 

N. Camp's clean. His ring
wasn't missing a stone. But
whoever was in that tank had a
ring just like his.

MELISSA
 

Wait a second. What ring?

Ace hands her the book. It's open to a photo of…

ACE
 

The 1982 Dolphin AFC Championship
ring.

Melissa holds the stone up to the picture. It's a perfect match.

ACE
 

I find the ring with the missing
stone, I find Snowflake.

MELISSA
 

How are you gonna do that?

ACE
 

Simple.

MUSIC UP

CUT TO:

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Ace is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who's running 
around the track at a very fast pace. When he finally catches up, he awkwardly tries to catch a 
glimpse of the man's ring and trips. The man just keeps going.

INT. FOOTLOCKER - DAY

Ace sits waiting with one shoe off. The store manager, an ex-player for the '82 team, sets down 
several shoe boxes. Ace checks out the ring.

CLOSE ON

A poster of the '82 team. The player we just saw is being crossed out.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Pan a few kids getting autographs from Marino and other players, ending on Ace dressed up and 
looking like a pimply kid. As the players sign, he checks their rings.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Ace is again trying to catch the large man on the track. This time, just as he draws near, the man 
leaves him in the dust.

INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

Two big guys finish arm wrestling. Ace steps up to challenge. He spends an undue amount of time 
preparing his grip, as he checks out the ring. Ace finally gets set and gives the "go ahead" nod. He 
is instantly thrown across the room.

CLOSE ON

The poster of the '82 team. Another group of players are being crossed out.

EXT. STREET

Ace spots a player driving along side him. He can't see his ring.

Ace deliberately cuts off the player's car and flips him off. The angry player flips Ace off. We see 
his ring is intact. Ace waves and drives off.

INT. MEN'S ROOM

One huge lineman uses a urinal. Ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a 
glimpse of the guy's hands. The Lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it 
changes to a "come on" smile.

CLOSE ON

The poster of the '82 team. There is only one face that has not been crossed out. Ace circles it.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Once again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. Suddenly Ace runs up behind him, 
with a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. He leaps onto the 
man's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. The man slowly gives up 
the fight and collapses. Ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed.

EXT. MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING

Ace sits in a lawn chair depressed. Melissa consoles him.

MELISSA
 

Ace, that stone could have come
from anywhere. An earring, a
necklace…

ACE

(with murder in his eyes)
 

It came from an '82 AFC
Championship ring.

MELISSA
 

Lt. Einhorn thinks it was an
animal rights group. Have you
heard of FAN?

ACE
 

Free Animals Now? Started in 1982
by Chelsea Gamble, daughter of the
famous industrialist, Fischer
Gamble? Over half a million
members from Florida to Finland?

(beat)
 

No. Who are they?

MELISSA
 

Did you know that last year they
sent threatening letters to 127
college teams, demanding the
release of their mascots? At last
count –

ACE
 

What do you feed your dog?

We see Melissa's dog lying near Ace's feet.

MELISSA
 

Ah… dog food, why?

ACE
 

He's miserable.

MELISSA
 

What are you talking about?

ACE
 

He's just very unhappy, I feel
sorry for him. Bad diet, isolated
environment. It's amazing he's
still alive.

MELISSA
 

You're just mad because your
stupid pebble theory didn't work
out and you don't know how to
express your anger.

ACE
 

Yeah? And you're ugly.

MELISSA
 

I'm not even gonna' talk to you,
please leave.

ACE
 

What, so you can beat him? Fatty!

MELISSA
 

You… are unbelievable.

The phone rings inside the house. Melissa goes to answer it.

MELISSA
 

Hiring you was a huge mistake!

The door slams and Ace is alone with the dog. After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we 
all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world.

ACE
 

You like her, huh?… Yeah, she's
alright.

Ace, feeling guilty, walks into the house.

INT. MELISSA'S DEN - CONT

Ace walks toward Melissa.

ACE
 

Look, Melissa, I, ah…

Ace stops when he sees Melissa. She is sitting, holding the phone in her lap with a completely 
stunned look on her face. Something is very wrong.

EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Chaos. Police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people.

Ace and Melissa see Roger Podacter's body taken away in an ambulance.

ACE
 

You okay?

Melissa nods bravely. Emilio joins them.

ACE
 

What'd you find?

EMILIO
 

Podacter, Roger. Routine suicide.
He was alone. He'd been drinking.
No sign of a struggle. Neighbor
heard him scream on the way down.
Just your classic fifteen story
swan dive.

Melissa shudders. Ace gives Emilio a "way to go" look.

EMILIO
 

Sorry.

INT. HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHT

The three enter. Emilio pushes the button for the elevator.

MELISSA
 

It just seems so out of character.
He was going to retire in two
years.

ACE
 

Did he leave a note?

The elevator arrives.

EMILIO
 

No. That's nothing unusual. Some
do, some don't. He didn't.

The elevator doors close.

INT. PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Police are everywhere. Emilio, Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of 
the officers.

EMILIO
 

Miss Robinson, this is officer
Carlson.

CARLSON
Evening, ma'am. I wonder if you
could answer a few questions about
the deceased?

Ace slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations.

NEIGHBOR

(to a cop)
 

I told you, I was across the hall
in my apartment, I heard a scream.
The door was locked, so I called
the manager…

The Manager reiterates her story to the cop. The Manager is about 100 years old.

MANAGER
 

…The place was empty, except for
the damn dog in the other room.
Then I opened the balcony door,
looked over the railing,
and… splat, bang, pancake time…

Ace, continuing his investigation notices…

PODACTER'S DESK

in perfect order.

Next, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting 
out the noise.

INT. PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A dog is cowering in the corner. Ace tries to comfort the little guy.

ACE
 

Hey, fella, have a bad night?

Ace examines its paws.

Ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door. TWO FEET interrupt.

Ace stands. He is face to face with Einhorn.

EINHORN
 

Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

Emilio steps in immediately.

EMILIO
 

Ah, Lieutenant. He came with Miss
Robinson –

EINHORN
 

This is official police business.
We'll let you know if the coroner
finds any ticks.

Cops snicker.

EMILIO
 

I just thought since Melissa –

ACE
 

E, forget it. She's right.
Besides, I wouldn't want someone
tracing my steps and pointing out
all the mistakes I made.

Ace crosses to…

EXT. PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONT

Ace examines the area. Einhorn is in hot pursuit.

EINHORN
 

Oh, so, you don't think this in an
obvious suicide, Mr. Pet
Detective?

ACE
 

Well, I wouldn't say that. Lord
knows, there is plenty of evidence
here to support your theory,
except of course that spot of
blood on the balcony.

On the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood.

Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. They look down.

ACE
 

May I tell you what I think
happened? Alrighty then!

Ace moves as he talks.

ACE
 

Roger Podacter went out after
work. He had a few drinks, and he
came home. But he wasn't alone. 
Someone was with him in this
apartment. There was a struggle,
and then Roger Podacter was thrown
over that balcony. Roger Podacter
didn't commit suicide. He was
murdered.

A beat as everyone considers this.

EINHORN
 

Well, that's a very entertaining
story, but real detectives have to
worry about that little thing
lawyers call evidence.

Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.

ACE
 

Let's take a trip to clue
corner, shall we? Can anyone tell
me why a man buys a lottery ticket
on the day he is going to commit
suicide? Or why the family pet,
suffering from acute canine
trauma, clawed at the bedroom door
until his paws bled? How about
the blood on the railing? I'll
bet if we put our thinking caps on
we'll see that it was the result
of the struggle that took place
inside this apartment while Mr.
Podacter was still alive!

(singing)
 

NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE
COME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER! BOOP!

Everyone looks to Einhorn.

EINHORN
 

Not a bad try for a pet detective,
but not near conclusive enough for
us real investigators.

(beat)
 

First, people buy lottery tickets
everyday. It's a habit. It
doesn't prove a thing. Second,
the dog wasn't suffering from
canine trauma, he was suffering
from bladder trauma. Sergeant
Neilson found a piss stain as big
as Lake Huron near the bed. And
third, the blood on the railing.
Simple. He doesn't jump far
enough and whacks his head. A
fact confirmed by the paramedics
who found cuts on his scalp, with
traces of a white chalky
substance. i.e. plaster from the
balcony.

Einhorn shows Ace the paramedics report. Everyone is impressed with Einhorn.

EINHORN
 

So much for your murder, Ventura.

AGUADO
 

Uh oh, I think I heard a toilet
flush. Maybe someone lost their
turtle?

Everyone has a laugh. Ace looks beaten.

ACE
 

Well, maybe I'm just a little out
of my league, here. Einhorn…

Ace holds out his hand, Einhorn shakes it.

ACE
 

…good work.

Ace and Melissa head for the door.

ACE
 

Oh, there is just one more thing,
Lieutenant.

(re: the neighbor)
 

This man is Roger Podacter's
neighbor. He lives across the
hall. He said he heard a scream,
is that right, sir?

The neighbor nods. Ace turns to the apartment manager.

ACE
 

And you said you had to open the
balcony door when you keyed into
the room?

MANAGER
 

That's right.

Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.

ACE
 

You're certain you had to open
this door?

She nods.

EINHORN
 

What's the point, Ventura?

ACE
 

Only this…
AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW…

Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door 
between them. When the door is closed nothing can be heard.

ACE

(tapping the door)
 

This is double paned, sound-
proofed glass. There's no way
this neighbor could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down
with this door shut. The scream
he heard came from inside this
apartment, before Podacter was
thrown over the railing! And the
muderer closed the door before he
left!

(celebrates insanely)
 

Yes! Yesss! I have exorcised the
demons!

(a la Poltergeist)
 

This house is clear.

INT. ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ace drives straight ahead.

MELISSA
 

What are you thinking?

ACE
 

I'm thinking this whole thing is
connected somehow.

(frustrated)
 

I'm thinking I want to find that
other ring!

MELISSA
 

You checked all the rings.

ACE
 

I know, Pessimistress. Could
anyone else have gotten a ring
that year?

MELISSA
 

No. Camp was the only honoree.
Just players and coaches.
Everyone in the photo.

ACE
 

…Receipts! There must be
receipts! You have a key to the
office.

MELISSA
 

Ace this has been a really tough
day. Can't we do this in the
morning?

Ace looks at his watch.

ACE
 

Absolutely.

EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - 1:00 AM

Ace's car screeches to a stop, in front of the building. Ace jumps out, followed by Melissa.

INT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

It's dark. Team pictures adorn the walls.

MELISSA (O.S.)
 

These files go back to seventy-
eight.

INT. DOLPHIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ace is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. Melissa is starting to warm to him.

MELISSA
 

That was pretty impressive, what
you did back at the apartment.

ACE

(still looking)
 

You don't have to tell me. I was
there.

MELISSA
 

Maybe you should have joined the
police force… become a real
detective.

ACE

(shaking his head)
 

I don't do humans.

Melissa gets a bit closer.

MELISSA
 

You really love animals, don't
you?

Ace stops searching and looks into her eyes.

ACE
 

I feel a kinship with them. I
understand them. Wanna hear
something kinda spooky?

MELISSA
 

Sure.

She gets closer still.

ACE
 

One time, when I was about twelve,
I had this dream that I was being
followed by a dog with rabies. He
had these really bloodshot eyes
and foam coming out of his
mouth… and just before I got to
my front door… he jumped on me
and sunk his teeth in. Then I
woke up, and felt the back of my
neck… check this out.

Ace motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, 
barking like a vicious dog.

ACE
 

ARARAR!!!

Melissa jumps out of her skin.

MELISSA
 

Ohhh!! You bastard!

ACE

(snickering)
 

I'm sorry. I couldn't stop
myself. Are these all the
receipts?

MELISSA

(mildly annoyed)
 

I don't know.

ACE
 

There's only a dozen of them here.

Ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. Melissa begins to clean up his 
mess.

MELISSA

(pointedly)
 

Gee… maybe they were misplaced
because somebody didn't put the
files back when he was…

ACE
 

Who the hell is that?

MELISSA
 

What…

Ace crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a 
player.

ACE
 

That! Who the hell is that?!

He quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two.

MELISSA
 

Oh, that's Ray Finkle… the
kicker. Don't you know who Ray
Finkle is?

ACE
 

No! How come he's not in this
picture?!

Melissa checks Ace's photo.

MELISSA
 

This was the picture you were
using? This was taken earlier in
the year. Finkle wasn't added to
the roster till mid-season.

She starts to realize what Ace has already figured out.

MELISSA (CONT'D)
 

He's the guy that missed the final
field goal in the Super Bowl that
year. Cost the Dolphins the game.

ACE
 

But he got a ring?

MELISSA
 

Definitely.

INT. STADIUM/PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE - LATER

Ace and Melissa look through Finkle's file on a microfiche screen. Newspaper articles, headshots 
flash before them…

MELISSA
 

'Replacement Kicker Having Great
Year'… 'Ready For Super Bowl,
Confident Kicker Boasts'.

ACE
 

'Field Goal Sails Wide, Dolphins
Lose Super Bowl'.

MELISSA
 

The kick heard round the world.
That was Finkle. The Dolphins lost
by one point.

Another headline hits the screen: FINKLE CONTRACT NOT RENEWED.

MELISSA
 

Poor guy.

ACE
 

Poor guy with a motive, baby.
Where is he now?

MELISSA
 

Last I heard, he went back to his
home town, Collier County. He
used to work in a bar up there.

ACE

(pondering)
 

REHEHEALLY.

MELISSA
 

Can you drop me off before you go?

ACE

(shaking his head)
 

No way. It may not be safe at
your apartment, and you shouldn't
be left alone.

MELISSA
 

What do you suggest?

CUT TO:

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - LATER

We see a person's butt under a sheet coming up into frame repeatedly.

SKIN, SWEAT, SHEETS FLY,  as Ace and Melissa roll back and forth on the bed. Ace is taking 
no prisoners.

CUT TO:

50 animals at the bottom of the bed, with eyes as big as silver dollars, watching them silently. We 
cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals.

Melissa and Ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure.

MELISSA

(totally amazed and exausted)
 

OH man… oh man! Oh wow!

ACE

(mock embarrassment)
 

I'm sorry… that's never happened
to me before. I must be tired.

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

Various traveling shots of Ace en route to a 'Deliverance' type town deep in the Everglades. A 
sign reads "Gas - Food - 2 Miles" but the word "Food" is crossed out.

INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY

A pitifully sad country song plays on the radio. FERN BILBO sits at his cluttered desk with the 
end of an old shotgun in his mouth. He is struggling to reach the trigger.

Through the glass behind him, we see Ace's car pull up to the only gasoline pump.

DING! The bell rings. Fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth, sets it down and walks 
out.

EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT

Ace gets out of his car.

ACE
 

Excuse me, sir. Do you know where
I can find the Pigskin Sports Bar?

FERN
 

Do I have a "kick me" sign on my
back, son?

ACE
 

I wouldn't know anything about
that, but if you could point me
toward the bar.

Fern breaks down, sobbing.

FERN
 

They all left me… all of them!

ACE
 

Well… Hypothetically speaking,
say they all left you and went to
the Pigskin Sports Bar. How would
they have gotten there from here?

FERN
 

Two miles down and take the first
left.

ACE
 

Thanks very much! Take care now,
'bye 'bye then!

Ace gets into his car and pulls out.

INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT

Fern enters, sits down at the desk, places the end of the shotgun in his mouth, reaches for the 
trigger and…

DING! Another car pulls up to the pump. Exasperated, he takes the gun out of his mouth.

FERN

(murmers to himself as he gets up)
 

Can't get anything done around
here…

EXT. PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY

A weathered dive in the middle of a swamp. Ace parks.

INT PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY

If depression had a home, this is it. Several dejected men, with various degrees of missing teeth, sit 
around the bar. A couple hapless guys play pool. One throws darts.

Ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room.

ACE
 

Excuse me, guy?! My name is Ace
Ventura, I'm a pet detective. I'd
like to ask you a few questions if
 I could.

No one even looks at him.

ACE
 

Just a few questions, that's all.

Still no one reacts.

ACE

(very up)
 

Who wants gum?!

Again, no reaction. Ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar.

ACE
 

I'm looking for a guy who used to
work here.

The bartender takes the money.

BARTENDER
 

That right?

ACE
 

He was a kicker for the Dolphins.
Ray Finkle.

A pool ball flies by Ace's head shattering a mirror behind the bar. All eyes are on Ace.

ACE

(to guy who threw it)
 

That would be a scratch.

TOOTHLESS GIANT
 

You a friend of Finkle's?

ACE

(thinks)
 

…Yes?

CRASH! The giant guy smashes his bottle.

ACE
 

Sorry, I have "say the opposite of
what you mean" disease.

Several undesirables surround Ace.

TOOTHLESS GIANT
 

That bastard ruined this town.

ACE
 

Ewww… I hate that!

HICK #2
 

We bet everything we had on that
Super Bowl and that son of a bitch
gagged.

ACE
 

What a diiick!

They all move closer in a threatening manner.

HICK #3
 

Shanked a goddamn 26 yarder!!!

ACE
 

Death to Finkle! Death to Finkle!

The bartender steps in.

BARTENDER
 

We had a hell of a thing going
here. Tourists coming to see Ray
Finkle's home town. He was
standing right over there when he
got the call from the Dolphins.

The bartender points to a payphone. It has had the shit beaten out of it. Every expletive you can 
think of is graffitied around it.

ACE
 

Did he come back after the Super
Bowl?

BARTENDER
 

Yeah… but the boys here had ways
of letting him know he wasn't
welcome.

HICK #1
 

Excuse me, I gotta take a wicked
Finkle.

Laughter.

TOOTHLESS GIANT
 

What's the difference between
Finkle and a jackass? A jackass
can kick.

More laughter.

HICK #2
 

Why did Finkle cross the
road?!

ACE

(facetious)
 

Wait…  I know this one.

HICK #2
 

He didn't! And I've got the hair on
my bumper to prove it!

Maniacal laughter and chanting ensues.

MOB
 

FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!
FINKLE SUCKS!

ACE
 

It's good you're dealing with the
anger.

(beat)
 

I don't suppose anyone's seen him
lately?

The chanting stops and the guys all look at Ace.

BARTENDER
 

No… but we know where his
parents live! Don't we boys?!

HICK #1
 

Yeah! We sure do!

They all laugh insanely again.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Ace pulls up outside a two-story stilt house. The place has been completely desecrated by graffiti, 
bullet holes and paint bombs. Toilet paper is strewn through the trees. Ace walks up and knocks 
on the door. A wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes.

ACE
 

…Hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle.

A gun slides out into Ace's face.

ACE

(with a gulp)
 

And a clean pair of shorts.

A deep gruff voice from inside.

VOICE
 

What do you know about Ray Finkle?

ACE
 

Southpaw soccer style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High in
June, 1976. Stetson University
honors graduate, class of 1980.
Holds two NCAA division one
records. One for most points in a
season, one for distance. Former
nickname The Mule. The first and
only pro athlete ever to come out
of Collier County. And one
helluva model American.

After a beat the peephole closes. The door slowly creaks open revealing MR. FINKLE, an 
unsmiling, taciturn, elderly man holding the gun.

MR. FINKLE
 

Are you another one of them
scumbags from 'Hard Copy'?

ACE
 

No, sir. I'm just a very big
Finkle fan. This is my Graceland,
sir.

Mrs. Finkle, a sweet, adorable elderly woman comes over.

MRS. FINKLE
 

Will you put that gun down. The
boy's a fan of our son. So nice
to meet you. I'm Ray's mother,
and this is Ray's father.

INT. FINKLE HOUSE - DAY

ACE
 

It's a real honor.

MRS. FINKLE
 

My Ray is so appreciative of his
fans. He'll be so pleased you
stopped by.

ACE
 

Are you expecting Ray anytime
soon?

MRS. FINKLE
 

Oh, yes. I expect him home any
minute.

Ace is surprised.

MRS. FINKLE
 

Would you like some cookies? I
just baked them.

Mrs. Finkle hurries off to the kitchen. Ace smiles at Mr. Finkle. The guy's a corpse.

ACE
 

Wow… Ray Finkle's house! Can't
wait to meet him!

MR. FINKLE
 

Ray ain't comin' home.

ACE
 

But your wife said you expect him
home any minute.

MR. FINKLE
 

She expects him home any minute.

He points to his head, and looks toward the kitchen.

MR. FINKLE
 

Engines runnin but there's no one
behind the wheel. Ten years ago
our son escaped from Shady Acres
Psychiatric Hospital in Tampa.
They're still buggin' us to pick
up his stuff.

Mrs. Finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies.

MRS. FINKLE

(sweetly)
 

It was all that Dan Marino's
fault, everyone knows that. If he
had held the ball laces out, like
you're supposed to, Ray would
never have missed that kick. Dan
Marino should die of Gonorrhea and
rot in Hell. Would you like a
cookie, son?

Ace takes a cookie. Holding it up.

ACE
 

Hey, what do ya know. They're
little footballs.

MRS. FINKLE
 

Laces OUT!

CRASH!! A large stone smashes through the window. Outside, a pickup truck filled with drunken 
patrons from the Pigskin Sports Bar drives by yelling their Finkle chant.

MOB
 

FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!…

MRS. FINKLE
 

I told you he had a lot of fans.

Mrs. Finkle picks up the rock and hurls it out the broken window. It hits one of the vandals, 
knocking him out cold, as the truck peels away.

MR. FINKLE

(aside to Ace)
 

She got the arm. The boy got the
leg.

INT. HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER

Mrs. Finkle and Ace are walking down the hallway to Ray's room.

MRS. FINKLE
 

When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again, he'll never even
know he was gone. I kept his room
just the way he left it.

She opens the door to Ray's room. Ace steps in.

INT. RAY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It's a death shrine to Dan Marino. Complete with lifesize cutouts of Dan Marino, some with 
nooses around the neck, other hacked to pieces. Painted on the walls: "Death to Marino!", 
Marino must die!!!, etc.

ACE
 

…Oooh boy.

MRS. FINKLE
 

What a sports nut, huh?

In the center of the room is a movie projector.

ACE
 

May I?

MRS. FINKLE
 

Oh yes. By all means.

Mrs. Finkle shuts the lights off. Ace turns on the projector.

The film flickers over the "Marino must die!!!" graffiti. It's the final play of the Super Bowl. 
Marino takes the snap, Finkle kicks and the ball sails wide. The film repeats itself ad infinitum.

EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY

Ace on the payphone. We see the gas station in the background.

ACE
 

Melissa, it's Ace.

INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY

MELISSA
 

Ace? Where are you?

INTERCUT ACE/MELISSA

ACE
 

I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's
the Mayor. Where's Dan Marino?

MELISSA
 

Marino? Why?

ACE
 

Because he's about to join
Snowflake. I gotta know where he
is.

MELISSA
 

Okay, hold on…

Melissa checks Marino's itinerary. Ace waits, impatiently.

ACE

(to himself)
 

Come on. Come on…

In the background, we see two paramedics exit the gas station office rolling a dead body on a 
gurney. The area of the sheet that covers the face is a giant red spot. We widen to see them load 
good old Mr. Bilbo into an ambulance and drive away, ringing the station bell one more time. Ace 
doesn't notice.

MELISSA
 

Ah, he had practice. Then… he
has a commercial shoot out at the
Prescott Sound Stage.

ACE
 

Where is that?

MELISSA
 

It's on Route One by the Six Cut
Off. Thirty minutes outside of
town.

ACE
 

Okay, that's about fifteen miles
from me. Call the police. Get
extra security over there now.

MELISSA
 

Ace, tell me what's going on.

(beat)
 

Ace?…

The payphone dangles off the hook. Ace is…

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

…in his car racing out of the swampland, his heaad now back out the window so he can see. He 
leaves a faded, old, barely legible sign in his wake:
"

WELCOME TO COLLIER
COUNTY. HOME OF RAY 
FINKLE"

The "F" in "FINKLE" has been replaced with "ST" in spray paint.

INT. PRESCOTT STUDIOS - DAY

Rehearsal for an Isotoner ad in progress.

MARINO
 

…So I protect the hands that
protect me. With Isotoners.

Marino gets carted off by FIVE HUGE LINEMEN.

DIRECTOR
 

Good. Remember, exit camera
right. That's to your left.
Alright, let's get ready to shoot
this.

FIRST A.D.

(to the linemen)
 

Helmets on this time!

The linemen disperse.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ace runs a red light causing cars to skid in every direction.

INT. PRESCOTT STUDIO - DAY

Marino is in the make-up chair.

MARINO

(to make-up girl)
 

See, in 82 we just choked. We had
a chance to win it and we
didn't –

DIRECTOR
 

Dan, are you ready?

MARINO
 

Ah, sure.

(to girl)
 

I'll tell you later.

EXT. STUDIO - DAY

The cops race onto the lot.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

Marino takes center stage.

A.D.
Quiet on the set… roll…
speed…

DIRECTOR
 

…And action!

MARINO
 

Hi, I'm Dan Marino. If anyone
knows the value of protection,
it's me…

We see an old clip of Marino getting sacked.

EXT. STUDIO - DAY

Cops scramble on foot to the sound stage.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

The commercial is winding up. The linemen ready themselves.

MARINO
 

…So I protect the hands that
protect me. With Isotoners.

The five linemen grab Marino and run off camera.

DIRECTOR
 

And cut! That was good. Again
from one.

But two of the linemen keep running with Marino…

DIRECTOR
 

I said cut!!

…And they keep running.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
 

What the hell are they doing?

…Right out the studio door. Then the cops arrive and race after them. Two linemen stumble out 
of the dressing room holding their heads.

EXT. SOUND STAGE - DAY

Ace skids around a corner, looking way up ahead.

He sees Marino being shoved into a black 81 Ford Bronco. They drive off.

The cops come out of the building on foot. Too late.

Ace in hot pursuit almost runs the cops down.

ACE

(yelling at cops)
 

S'cuse meee! Pet Detective!

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Ace's head is out the driver's window through the entire chase. As he starts gaining on the bad 
guys, they start shooting. Ace wisely puts his head inside the car.

ACE'S POV

He can't see shit through his broken windshield.

He pokes his head out again. They shoot again.

Ace swerves off the road into…

EXT. PARK - DAY

Ace's car smashes through benches and tables. Then it flips over a few times and lands on its 
wheels with a horrid SMASH. Ace is still strapped into the drivers seat, unconscious.

Ace's prized WHITE PIGEON lands on the car door right beside him. Ace cracks his eyes and 
sees the bird. Then, with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands, and forgets all 
about Marino.

ACE
 

I did it! I did it! I caught the
white pigeon! I caught the white
pigeon!

Ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his 
head. He looks insane.

ACE (CONT'D)

(singing)
 

I caught the white pigeon, I
caught the white pigeon, I caught
the white…

Ace slows down and begins to look around warily. There are now an unusual number of birds 
perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars, and on the swings.

The sky grows darker. He slowly turns and tries to get back to the car. All the birds take flight.

Ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run, but it's too late. The birds are on him. Pecking, 
and gouging, and ripping his flesh.

Now we see ten birds flying away with a leg. Five birds flying away with an arm. Twenty others 
are trying to take Ace's left arm off, and half his face is missing…

ACE
 

AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

Ace is back in his wrecked car with his arm hanging out the window. A small boy is pulling it.

BOY
 

Hey mister. Hey mister.

Ace come to suddenly, and looks at the boy with a crazed expression.

BOY (CONT'D)
 

That was a really neat crash,
mister. Do it again!

Ace sighs with relief.

EXT. MIAMI - DAY

Various headlines hit the news stands: "MARINO KIDNAPPED" "STAR QB MISSING" "DAN 
WHERE ARE YOU?"

THE GLOBE HEADLINE: "MARINO ABDUCTED BY ALIEN FRANCHISE!" On the cover, 
Marino stands with several Space Aliens in football gear.

EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY

A chaotic press conference. Zillions of REPORTERS shout all kinds of questions at Einhorn.

REPORTER
 

Lieutenant, have there been any
ransom demands?

EINHORN
 

There's been no communication with
the kidnappers at this time.

REPORTER #2
 

What's going to happen to the
Super Bowl? Will it be postponed?

EINHORN
 

As of now, the game is going on as
scheduled.

REPORTER #3
 

Why wasn't the public told about
Snowflake's kidnapping?

EINHORN
 

Secrecy was essential. We didn't
want any public interference.

REPORTER
 

Are the crimes related? And what
about Roger Podacter's murder?

EINHORN
 

I'm sorry. I can't comment any
further. Now if you'll excuse me.

Einhorn pushes her way through the crowd of reporters.

INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Einhorn is barking out orders to other cops as she heads for her office.

EINHORN
 

Emilio, get me the autopsy on
Podacter! Aguado, send out a
memo. No one talks to the
press…

INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

EINHORN
 

…And somebody get me a cup of
coffee!

ACE

(TV announcer's voice)
 

Tonight on "MIAMI VICE", Crockett
geets the boss coffee!

Ace is in her office, popping sunflower seeds, kicking back. Einhorn walks to her private 
bathroom.

EINHORN
 

Ventura, when I get out of this
bathroom, you better be gone.

ACE
 

Is it number one or number two?

Einhorn turns and glares at Ace.

ACE
 

I just want to know how much time
I have.

Einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands.

ACE
 

Oh, by the way, I went ahead and
solved that pesky,
Snowflake/Podacter/Marino thing.

EINHORN (O.S.)

(humoring him)
 

Oh yeah?

ACE
 

yeah, ever hear of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

The water shuts off. Einhorn appears around the corner.

EINHORN
 

Alright, Ventura. Make it quick.

ACE
 

I found a rare stone at the bottom
of Snowflake's tank. It's from a
Dolphin '82 AFC Championship ring.
It would have been a Super Bowl
ring, but Ray Finkle missed the
big kick. Blames the whole thing
on Marino. We're talking
paranoid, delusional psychosis. I
saw the guy's room… Cozy, if
you're Hannibal Lector.

EINHORN
 

So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

ACE
 

My guess is Finkle was snooping
around. Podacter recognized him.
End of story. As for Snowflake…
they gave him Finkle's number, and
taught him how to kick a field
goal. Finkle took it personally.

Einhorn listens with great interest.

EINHORN
 

So where is Finkle, now?

ACE
 

He broke out of a metal hospital.
Did a Claude Raines. He's been
planning his revenge for years.
Waiting for the perfect time to
get back at the Dolphins. The time
when it would hurt them the most.
Super Bowl time! Man, I'm tired
of being right!

Einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk. She's totally softened her demeanor.

EINHORN
 

Congratulations. You've done some
fine detective work, Ace.

ACE
 

Ahh, could you talk in my good
ear. I thought I heard you call
me Ace.

Einhorn gets real close.

EINHORN
 

Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet
dick.

SHE SUDDENLY PLANTS A MAJOR, TONSIL CLEANING, OPEN MOUTHED KISS ON 
ACE. Objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back.

ACE
 

Your gun's digging into my hip.

More kissing, the Ace stops.

EINHORN

(still coming on)
 

What's wrong, Ace? Want me to
read you your rights?

ACE
 

Maybe later.

EINHORN
 

What is it? That bony little
bitch, Melissa Robinson?

ACE

(defensive)
 

No. You just don't do anything
for me.

He quickly adjusts his crotch, to conceal the erection. Einhorn withdraws with a coy smile.

EINHORN
 

I'll be here if you ever want a
real woman.

There's a sharp KNOCK at the door.

EINHORN
 

What is it?

Aguado opens the door.

AGUADO
 

Everything okay in here?  Heard
some commotion.

EINHORN
 

Fine, Sergeant.

AGUADO
 

You want me to throw him out?

EINHORN
 

Why don't you throw yourself out.

AGUADO
 

…Yes, ma'am.

A crestfallen Aguado exits. Ace heads for the door.

EINHORN
 

Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.

ACE
 

Can't do that, Lieutenant. I was
hired to find Snowflake.

EINHORN
 

When we find Marino, We'll deliver
Snowflake.

ACE
 

When I find Snowflake, I'll
deliver Marino.

He exits.

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

A full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage. Kids leap wildly into the moshing pit. The same 
Burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music.

ACE

(shouting)
 

Nice to see you again!

The Burnout just keeps thrashing. Ace spots Woodstock watching the band and joins him.

WOODSTOCK
 

St. Francis, how's it goin'?

ACE

(kidding)
 

That's none of your damn business.

WOODSTOCK
 

Isn't it?

ACE
 

Is it?

WOODSTOCK
 

Anything new on that dolphin?

ACE
 

Got his picture on some tuna cans,
but nothing so far.

A singer ROARS on stage. He sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery.

SINGER
Arroohhghhh! Myrrrooohghhhh!
Geroooghhh!

WOODSTOCK
 

So, what can I do for you today?

ACE
 

I need info on a football flunky
named Ray Finkle.

WOODSTOCK
 

Sorry, Ace, I can't help you right
now. I gotta watch this band!
They are the shit!

ACE
 

Are they?

WOODSTOCK
 

Aren't they?

ACE
 

Alright then. Don't worry about
it. I mean dolphins aren't
exactly an endangered species.
It's not like the whole food
chain's gonna be affected if one
highly intelligent mammal dies a
slow and painful death! Hell, if
the band is loud enough, you won't
even hear its pitiful whimpering!!

Ace does his best suffering dolphin impression. Woodstock is no longer enjoying the band.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Woodstock is at his computer. Ace looks over his shoulder. Finkle's Social Security information 
appears on the screen.

WOODSTOCK
 

This guy's last reported income
was September, 1982.

ACE
 

Well then. We know he's
incredibly thrifty.

WOODSTOCK
 

Is he?

ACE
 

Isn't he?

Woodstock types in more information. Finkle's TRW flashes on the screen.

WOODSTOCK
 

Well, I think we can be pretty
sure he's involved in the
kidnapping of the dolphin.

ACE
 

Really? What makes you say that?

WOODSTOCK
 

There's two-thousand dollars worth
of smelts on his VISA card.

After a beat Ace realizes it was a bad joke.

ACE
 

Please yank me no further. I beg
of you.

WOODSTOCK
 

Alright already. The last time
this guy used his credit card was
June, '84. He rented a car from
Avis. And… eww… he was a bad
boy. They found it abandoned two
months later in South Miami.

ACE
 

Anything else?

WOODSTOCK
 

Nope.

ACE
 

Well… you did all you could.
Thanks for nothin.

WOODSTOCK
 

Hey man, according to this, your
friend Ray Finkle doesn't exist.

ACE
 

Hmm, I know what that's like.

WOODSTOCK
 

Do you?

ACE
 

Don't I?

INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Ace emerges from the basement. The band is between songs. Ace strolls by the burnout whose 
head has now stopped.

ACE

(to burnout)
 

Did you get all the spiders outta
there?

Ace heads out, then freezes. The two thugs that took Marino are standing at the exit. Then they 
see Ace and start towards him, reaching inside their coats.

Suddenly the music starts. The burnout's head wails again. His manic gyrations interfere with the 
thugs long enough for Ace to bolt.

One of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue Ace.

BURNOUT

(calling, as he gets up)
 

Thanks, man! You're a great
dancer!

Ace pushes his way through the crowd. The thugs follow.

Ace nears the stage. It's wild. People are diving off and getting moshed.

Before the thugs grab him, Ace runs up and throws himself from the stage. The insane crowd 
begins to pass him around over their heads.

The thugs exchange a look, then dive after Ace, and a "mosh" chase ensues.

Ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end. The singer is lying there 
exhausted. Ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down, so he quickly grabs the microphone 
off the floor.

ACE

(screams)
 

ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, SPANK ME
MOMMY!!!

The audience looks at Ace for a second. Then the band members exchange a look and go for it!!

It's a nightmarish little ditty. Ace sings like one of Satan's minions.

ACE
 

URGHHUURRAAAW! ARGHUURRRREEEW!

The crowd seems to understand. They throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away 
from the stage. The Thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time.

Ace incites the crowd, even more now, with a punching gesture. The crowd follows their new 
leader, punching with one hand, moshing with the other.

The thugs get the living crap "moshed" out of them.

When the song ends, Ace raises fists in the air. The cheering crowd violently drops the thugs. 
They're out cold.

EXT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT

Ace's car PEELS OUT and races by the parked '81 Ford Bronco.

EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ace's car skids to a halt. He hops out.

INT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There's a loud BANGING at the door. Melissa awakens, looks at the clock: 3:32 a.m. She drags 
herself to the door.

MELISSA
 

Who is it?

ACE (O.S.)
 

Ira.

MELISSA
 

Ira who?

ACE (O.S.)
 

I refuse to do a 'knock knock
joke'. Come on, open up!

Melissa opens the door.

MELISSA
 

Ace, what are you doing? It's the
middle of the night!

ACE
 

You have to commit me.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

Ace's clunker speeds down the highway.

ACE (V.O.)
 

Finkle escaped from Shady Acres in
Tampa. They still have some of
his stuff.

MELISSA (V.O.)
 

So you think they're going to let
us just waltz in and look around?

EXT. SHADY ACRES - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A state hospital located on acres of green, manicured lawns.

INT. SHADY ACRES - DAY

The reception area. A DOCTOR is before Melissa.

DOCTOR
 

Mrs. Robinson? I'm Doctor Handly.
Now who is it that you'd like to
have us look at?

MELISSA
 

My brother… Eugene.

ANGLE ON ACE - Looking like the football player who never wore a helmet.

ACE
 

I'm ready to go in, Coach. Just
give me a chance. I know there's a
lot riding on it, but it's all
psychological. Got to stay in a
positive frame of mind. Memorize
the play book. Study the films.

Ace strikes a dramatic pose and freezes, with a crazed look on his face.

ACE (CON'T)
 

I'm gonna execute a button-hook
pattern!

He begins to make a play in slow motion.

ACE (CON'T)
 

Super slo-mo!

CUT TO:

EXT. SHADY ACRES HOSPITAL - DAY

Melissa walks with the Doctor. Patients are sitting around, doing outdoor therapy, etc.

DOCTOR
 

You're brother won't be the first
professional football player we've
treated.

MELISSA
 

Is that right?

DOCTOR
 

Yes. We're very sensitive to the
emotional stress athletes have to
endure.

Ace runs across the b.g. screaming "I'm open! I'm open!"

DOCTOR
 

We'll have to do some preliminary
evaluations, but I think your
brother will fit in nicely here.

MELISSA
 

That's a relief, Doctor.

Ace takes a "snap" from a three-foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone. Melissa and the 
doctor stop to watch him.

DOCTOR
 

He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game. Has he
had a long history of mental
illness?

MELISSA

(truthfully)
 

As long as I've known him.

Ace does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating.

INT. SHADY GLADE ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY

The doctor is showing Melissa around. Ace is walking alongside them adjusting his imaginary 
shoulder pads.

DOCTOR
 

This is our therapy room… Arts
and crafts…

They turn a corner. Ace squats to pick the dirt out of his cleats.

DOCTOR (CON'T)
 

That's the storage room. This
hallway leads to another
recreational area –

Ace WHISTLES loudly and gestures like a referee…

ACE
 

HALFTIIIIME!!

Ace sticks his head in the water fountain then sits down on the bench outside the storage room.

MELISSA
 

He'll be fine by himself for the
next twenty minutes.

DOCTOR
 

Well, why don't I show you the
dormitories, then?

They leave Ace.

After a beat, Ace gets up and does a quick spin pattern into the storage room door.

INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Cartons everywhere. Ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked FINKLE.

Ace looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes. In the third box, he hits the 
jackpot: He finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to Marino. Die-Dan potholders, shredded 
Isotoner gloves. He opens a little diary. "Laces Out!" is insanely scrawled on every page.

Ace finds a newspaper clipping, the headline reads:

SEARCH CALLED OFF FOR MISSING HIKER

ACE

(reading)
 

A massive search ended today when
rescue workers were unable to find
the body of Lois Einhorn…

(stunned)
 

…a camper reported lost since
Friday…

(to himself)
 

Lois Einhorn… holy shit balls.

Ace sits bewildered.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The phone rings at Emilio's desk. He answers it.

EMILIO
 

Echavez.

INT. SHADY ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY

Ace is on the phone. A CRAZY GUY is hovering nearby.

ACE
 

This is Chicken Little. The sky
is falling.

EMILIO
 

What?

BACK TO EMILIO

A beat as he listens to Ace's news.

EMILIO
 

I don't get it. What's it mean?

INTERCUT ACE/EMILIO

ACE
 

It means she's involved in this.
The article's dated the day before
Finkle disappeared.

EMILIO
 

Before who disappeared?

ACE
 

Finkle. Ray Finkle… the guy who
took the dolphin? The guy you're
supposed to be looking for?!
Einhorn didn't tell you, did she?

EMILIO
 

Hey, Ace. I see where you're
goin' with this and you're goin'
alone.

A Crazy Guy stands next to Ace now and begins mimicking everything he says.

ACE
 

Come on, E. I tell her about
Finkle, she doesn't tell a soul.
I have an article here that
connects her with Finkle. You
gotta' check her out.

(to Crazy Guy mimicking)
 

Do you mind?

The Crazy Guy stops and moves to one of the phones.

EMILIO
 

Ace, I like my job. I get health
insurance and benefits.

CRAZY GUY

(into receiver)
 

I'm the Lindberg Baby. Come and
get me.

ACE
 

Emilio, Einhorn is involved.
You're gonna' have to make a
decision here.

(beat)
 

Listen, I gotta get off the phone.
I think I just solved the Lindberg
case.

Melissa and the Doctor return.

DOCTOR
 

Well, look who's trying to use the
phone.

Ace covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice.

ACE
 

Brian Piccalo is dead.

Ace breaks down. Melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away.

We hear a thrash version of the theme to "Brian's Song" as they exit the hospital.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Emilio stands at a window, watching Einhorn drive off. The coast is clear so he sneaks into…

INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He rifles through her file cabinet. He tears through papers. Then he looks in her desk.

Stuffed in the back of the drawer he finds a personal note: We can make out the signature. 
Roger. He pockets it and walks out.

EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ace and Melissa pull up in the old heap.

ACE
 

Good job today. You're quite a
dirty rotten filthy liar.

MELISSA

(flattered)
 

Thanks. Are you sure you don't
want to stay here with me?

ACE
 

Naw, I got some thinking to do.
Besides, you'd be safer with
Salman Rushdie

MELISSA
 

Okay.

She gets out of the car, then turns and leans in the window.

MELISSA
 

Listen… I know there isn't much
time left. The game is tomorrow.
But I know you've done your best.
It's just an impossible situation.
I don't expect..

ACE
 

Hey…

Ace leans over and kisses her.

ACE (CONT'D)
 

…bet on the Dolphins.

INT. ACE'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

CLOSE UP: ANSWERING MACHINE

Wiggles' nose enters frame and hits the play button.

MESSAGE #1

(Shickadance rasp)
 

Venturaaaa? Your time is up!
You're out! You hear me?! No
rent… no roof!

We widen to find Ace on the couch listening.

MESSAGE #2
 

Ace, it's E. Got something you
might find interesting. It's a
note from Podacter to Einhorn,
thanking her for a wonderful
Saturday night. This is too
weird, man?

ACE
 

Wiggles, rewind.

Wiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape. Ace pops sunflower seeds, 
and holds some evidence aloft thinking. A bird eats seeds out of his naval.

ACE
 

What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle? Come
on, think!

DISSOLVE TO:

Later. Ace is posed like Rodin's "The Thinker".

ACE
 

Finkle and Einhorn. In it
together. How? Why?

A small monkey sits in the same position. Mocking Ace.

DISSOLVE TO:

Later still. Ace pacing, jumping up and down. Trying to get his intuitive juices flowing. The 
monkey is likewise, jumping on the mantle.

ACE
 

Alright! Here we go! Answer's
right there! Just gotta get some
blood to the brain! Finkle and
Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and
Einhorn!

The animals all watch him like he's crazy.

DISSOLVE TO:

Daybreak. Ace sits staring at a picture of Finkle on the coffee table. He's totally spent and on the 
verge of tears.

ACE

(whimpering)
 

Finkle and Einhorn. Einhorn and
Finkle.

He turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow.

ACE

(to sleeping monkey)
 

Quitter.

Wiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now. Ace can't be bothered with him.

ACE
 

What do you want? Huh?

Wiggles whines at the tone of Ace's voice.

ACE (CONT'D)
 

What? I got no food for you. You
gotta have money to buy food. I
gotta find the dolphin to get the
money. I don't see any dolphins
around here, do you? Face it,
it's hopeless… your master is a
LOSER.

Ace buries his face in his hands. His dog Wiggles does the same. Then Ace looks up again.

ACE
 

LOO… HOO…

Suddenly he is silenced by something amazing.

Wiggles' dark haired floppy ears are lying around Finkle's picture like a wig. Ace combs the hair 
over the head shot. The "make-over" is unmistakable. It's Einhorn!!

ACE
 

Oh, my god! That's it!

He jumps up, estatic.

ACE
 

Einhorn is Finkle! Finkle is
Einhorn!… Einhorn is a man!!!

Ace's expression quickly turns sour.

ACE
 

OH MY GOD!!! EINHORN IS A MAN!!!

MUSIC UP: AEROSMITH'S DUD LOOKS LIKE A LADY…

Ace makes a mad dash into the bathroom.

INT. ACE'S BATHROOM - MORNING - QUICK CUTS

…Ace furiously brushes his teeth.

…Ace rinses with mouthwash, spits it out and gags.

…Ace is in the shower. He slowly curls up into a ball under the steaming water with an expression 
of horror on his face.

INT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE UP:

A woman's leg being shaved.

Woman sexily putting on nylons.

Woman hands squeezing perfume bulb.

Woman's hand putting on AFC championship ring. One stone is missing.

EXT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ace sticks wads of gum in his mouth while he watches Einhorn's house from his car.

ACE

(remembering)
 

You're gun is sticking into my hip.
Yeeeekkkk!

Einhorn comes out her front door and gets into her car. Ace shudders once more and then follows 
her.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

The road is jammed in one direction. Going towards the Super Bowl. Einhorn drives in the 
opposite direction. Out of town. Ace tails her at a safe distance, with his head out the window, of 
course.

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

Various shots of crazy fans, piling into the stadium.

INT. STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY

Melissa, BOBBY RIDDLE, and GUESTS all amidst the usual pre-game hobnobbing. Most of the 
talk centers on the loss of Marino.

Emilio, in full uniform, and a couple cops are providing extra security for the box.

EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY

Einhorn drives south out of town. The area's getting remote. Ace follows.

Einhorn turns down a deserted road and comes to…

EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

A large, abandoned industrial facility. Einhorn parks, disappears inside…

A few beats later, Ace kills the engine and exits singing the score to "Mission Impossible".

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Immense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons.

Ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. He stops when he 
hears a familiar voice.

JOHN MADDEN (O.S.)
 

I particularly like the match-ups
of the defense.

Ace sees a weird sight: A HUGE TV PROJECTION SCREEN tuned to the Super Bowl pre-game 
show. Marino is tied to a football tackling sled. The two thugs take turns running into Dan with 
their shoulders, driving him back five feet each time.

JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)
 

…But the real story of this game
is the absence of Dan Marino. Him
being kidnapped and all has got to
be a strain on this Miami team. I
really feel sorry for those guys! I
mean, it's hard enough enduring
the pressure of the Super Bowl,
without your star quarterback
gettin' himself kidnapped. This
is the whole ball of wax, folks!
You wanna' get kidnapped, you do
it in the off season!…

Marino looks incredulously at the screen. Next to him, Snowflake "watches" from a ground level 
cistern serving as an ad hoc tank.

Ace sneaks closer.

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY

The crowd quiets as Jon Bon Jovi prepares to sing the National Anthem.

Various shots of fans all standing at attention.

In the owners box, Melissa looks to Emilio. Nothing's new.

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Einhorn is now in front of the big screen TV SINGING the National Anthem along with Bon Jovi. 
The thugs, VINNIE and ROC, are behind her standing at attention.

The song ends. The crowd cheers.

In a sultry fashion Einhorn circles Marino now.

EINHORN
 

I just love Super Bowl Sunday,
don't you, Dan? A magical
afternoon where dreams are made…
or crushed!

DAN
 

Look lady, if you want tickets,
you're going about it in the wrong
way.

EINHORN
 

Do I look familiar to you, Dan?
Does it seem as if we've met
someplace before?

DAN
 

I don't know… I get hit in the
head a lot!

On the TV the ref makes an announcement.

REF
It's tails. The Eagles will
receive.

Dan really struggles now.

EINHORN
 

Oops. Looks like we're going to
have to kick, Dan.

Einhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee. And in perfect sync with the kicker on TV, she 
boots a ball through a window of the warehouse.

Marino doesn't know what to think.

EINHORN
 

I made some refreshments, Dan.
Would you like some refreshments,
Dan? I'll be right back,
Daaaan!!

She goes. Dan struggles, but to no avail.

MARINO
 

Look, I don't know how much psycho
woman is paying you guys, but I
can double it.

VINNIE
 

Sorry, Danny boy. Psycho woman
keeps us out of prison.

Vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices Snowflake to the surface. Roc raises a football.

ROC
Hey, Marino, check it out. I'm
throwin' passes to a Dolphin!

He chucks the ball and hits Snowflake, hard. The thugs both laugh hysterically.

Snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs. Snowflake laughs now, the thugs are 
furious.

VINNIE
 

Get some more fish!

INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS

Roc walks behind a big piece of machinery, reaches down for the pail of smelts, but sees nothing.

ROC
Where the hell's the smelts?

He stands up straight and we all hear that familiar "Pop" of a sunflower seed being cracked open.

Roc's eyes widen. He turns and sees…

Ace coyly smiles at him, blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and CLANG! He whacks 
Roc in the head with a pail full of fish.

ACE

(doing Brando)
 

He sleeps with the fishes.

INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUS

VINNIE
 

Hey Roc, what the hell was that?

Vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound.

INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS

Vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts 
lined up on the ground.

He follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc, unconscious but moaning. He is sitting 
against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. The trail of smelts leads 
to his crotch. There is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping.

Vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to Roc and stands him up.

VINNIE
 

Hey man! What happened? What's
goin on…?

We see Ace at the top of a giant machine. He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a 
chain from the ceiling.

ACE
 

Guess what, boys, it's nap time.

Ace gently releases the hook. Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of 
their heads clean off.

Two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks.

CLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIED

ACE
 

Hooooly Shiiit! Oh my god! I
didn't mean to - Oh man!!!

Ace holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done.

ACE

(looking to God)
 

Lord, I swear! I just wanted to
knock them out!

Ace abruptly stops to think.

ACE
 

Is that murder? I don't know.
They were gonna kill me. But they
didn't… But they tried. That's
self defense. That's it!! I have
nothing to worry about!!

CUT TO:

Ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook.

INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORY

Ace checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino. He signals for Dan to keep quiet, then starts to 
untie him.

MARINO

(whispers)
 

Who are you?

ACE

(whispers)
 

Ace Ventura. Pet detective. I've
been sent in with a special play.

(whispers)
 

Quarterback sneak.

WE HEAR THE CLICK OF A GUN.

EINHORN (O.S.)
 

Penalty. Too many men on the
field.

Ace turns. Einhorn's holding a gun on them from the other side of Snowflake's tank.

EINHORN (CON'T)
 

I warned you, Ventura.

ACE
 

What happened to "Ace"?

EINHORN
 

Good question.

She pulls out a cellular phone and dials.

ACE
 

Be careful with that phone,
lieutenant. I wouldn't want you
to get a tumor.

EINHORN

(into phone)
 

Sergeant Aguado, it's Lt. Einhorn.
Get some men over to the old
ironworks factory on Victoria
Road. I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse. It's
Ace Ventura. He's killed Marino
and Snowflake.

Einhorn smiles as she puts the phone away.

EINHORN
 

Vinnie! Roc! Get in here!

Ace gets a very guilty look.

ACE
 

What? Who are they? You mean
there's other people here?

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A battalion of cop cars screech away as we hear…

RADIO DISPATCHER

(V.O.)
 

Attention all units. Code 11 in
progress at 343 Victorville Road.
Officer needs back-up…

INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY

The cops and Emilio listen to their ear pieces…

RADIO DISPATCHER

(V.O.)
 

…Suspect's name: Ace Ventura,
male Caucasian, he is armed and
dangerous…

Emilio nudges Melissa.

EMILIO
 

It's Ace. Let's go.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Emilio high tails it out of there. Dodging concession stand patrons, bathroom lines, etc… Melissa 
runs behind, trying to catch up.

MELISSA
 

Emilio, is he in trouble?

EMILIO
 

Don't worry, there's nothing Ace
can't handle!

INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - DAY

Einhorn cocks her gun. Ace's face is glistening with tears. He's a complete wreck.

ACE
 

Don't kill meeee!!
Pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! I'll
never tell anyone! I swear!

(indicating Marino)
 

He's the one you want!! Kill
him!!

MARINO

(indicating Ace)
 

No… kill him!

The two argue. Einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them.

EINHORN
 

No, I'm gonna kill the dolphin
first.

(to Ace)
 

I wouldn't want you to miss that.

Einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES!

We see the bullet miss Snowflake under water.

Snowflake swims wildly. She FIRES again! Misses again. Suddenly, Ace HOLLERS!

ACE
 

Blue forty-two!!

Einhorn turns to Ace.

EINHORN
 

SHUT UP!!

ACE
 

BLUE FORTY-TWO!

Einhorn shoots at Ace! He dives out of the way.

ACE
 

HUT! HUT!

Suddenly, Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn's hand, like the trick 
we saw earlier. Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.

ACE

(smug)
 

Yes. The highly trained dolphin.
Perhaps the smartest mammal in the
animal kingdom. See how he knew
exactly what I wanted him to do,
as if our minds were somehow in
complete synchronization. They
have been know to save men at sea
you know. They have their own
language.

(to Snowflake)
 

Snowflake. Come here, Snowflake!
Bring me the gun!

(makes dolphin sounds)
 

EEEEEE! EEEEEE! EEEEEE!

Just like the trick in his routine, however, Snowflake swims around the tank, passes Ace, then 
hands the gun back to Einhorn. He finishes with a tail walk.

ACE

(under his breath)
 

Stupid fish.

ON TV: Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.

JOHN MADDEN
 

He got all of his leg into that
one!

The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.

ACE
 

Good to see someone who doesn't
buckle under the pressure?

MARINO
 

Yeah, not like in 82 when we
choked…

Einhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head.

EINHORN
 

What would you know about
pressure?

ACE
 

Well, I've kissed a man.

JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)
 

Of course, there's never been a
more crucial kick than the famous
Kick heard 'round the world…

The famous footage airs on TV. They all turn to watch.

JOHN MADDEN
 

…I mean, it's clear to me that
it was a good hold. Finkle just
booted it.

EINHORN
 

The laces weren't out. THE LACES
WEREN'T OUT!!

Einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in Madden's forehead. Ace uses the moment to 
smack the gun out of her hand.

A HUGE, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues. Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the 
face and stomach.

Einhorn throws a punch at Ace. Ace goes down.

Einhorn goes for the loose gun. Ace leaps and tackles her.

They both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. Marino struggles all the 
while trying to get free.

Einhorn kicks Ace. He flies into Marino.

MARINO
 

Having a little trouble with the
lady, Ace?

ACE

(out of breath)
 

You don't understand, she's a –

Einhorn grabs Ace, throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face.

Meanwhile, cops start arriving, SWAT team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight 
continues. They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor.

More punches. They fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. To the amazement of the SWAT 
team, Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals.

AGUADO

(caught up)
 

Get him, Lois!

Now they crash through a plate glass window together. Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles 
toward the gun. It's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had.

EINHORN

(screaming)
 

Shoot him! Shoot him!

We all hear the guns cocked. We see Ace in the rifle sights. We see fingers twitch on triggers.

A loud voice comes from off camera.

EMILIO
 

DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE!

Melissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin.

MELISSA
 

Put down your guns or this cop
gets it!

The SWAT team hesitates.

MELISSA (CONT'D)
 

I mean it!!

Much to Emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun.

EMILIO

(whispers to Melissa)
 

Ah… Melissa? That's a hair
trigger.

(loud to cops)
 

She's not joking!

The SWAT team leader signals his men. They lower their guns. Einhorn gets back to her feet.

EINHORN
 

He kidnapped Snowflake. He killed
Roger Podacter, and he was about
to kill Dan Marino and me!

ACE
 

Ho, ho! Fiction can be fun! But
I find the reference section much
more enlightening.

(doing his best Clarence Darrow)
 

For instance, if you were to look
up 'professional football's all
time bonehead plays', you might
read about a Miami Dolphin kicker
named Ray Finkle, who missed a
twenty-six yard field goal in the
closing seconds of Super Bowl
Seventeen.

(in one breath)
 

What you wouldn't read about is
how Ray Finkle lost his mind, and
was committed to a mental
institute, only to escape and join
the police force under the assumed
identity of a missing hker,
seducing her way to the top, in a
diabolical plan to get even with
Dan Marino whom he blamed for the
entire thing!!!

Ace gasps for air. Everyone is totally confused.

AGUADO
 

What the hell are you trying to
say?

ACE
 

She's not Lois Einhorn! She's Ray
Finkle! She's a man!

EINHORN
 

He's lying! Shoot him!

Ace walks over to her.

ACE
 

Let's just see who's lying. Would
a real woman have to wear one of
these?

Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is 
real. Ace keeps tugging it.

The SWAT team ready themselves.

ACE (CONT'D)
 

Boy, that's really on there! But
tell me this: Would a real woman
be missing these?!

Ace rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.

The sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.

ACE
 

Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgery
can be done over the weekend! But
I doubt if she could find the time
during her busy schedule to get
rid of Mr. Knish!!

Ace rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect 
figure of a woman.

ACE
 

Oooh boy.

Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan 
Marino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.

MARINO
 

Psst… Ace. Come here.

ACE

(to everyone)
 

Could you excuse me just a second.

Ace goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.

EINHORN
 

Shoot him. Shoot him, now!!

MELISSA

(to cops)
 

Don't anybody make a move!

Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the 
crowd.

ACE
 

Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed
colleague Mr. Marino, has just
brought some new evidence to my
attention. Now, history has
certainly shown that even the most
intuitive criminal minds can be
wrong, from time to time. But, if
I have been mistaken… if the
lieutenant is indeed a woman…
then my friends, she is suffering
from the worst case of hemorrhoids
I have ever seen!!!

Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle 
has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)

Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.

FINKLE

(deepest voice possible)
 

It was Marino's fault. The laces
were in.

(breaking down now)
 

They were IN!!!

Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.

Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his 
spout.

Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.

ACE
 

Somebody read it its rights.

Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.

FINKLE
 

DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!

Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After 
a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.

FINKLE

(gasping for air)
 

Help I can't swim!!!

Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.

Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side 
of the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.

Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We 
see that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a 
perfect fit.

ACE
 

LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERR
HERR!!!

Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.

EMILIO
 

Melissa… you can give me back my
gun now.

Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.

Now Aguado appears beside Ace.

AGUADO
 

I don't know how you did it,
Ventura… but that was damn good
police work. Alright guys, let's
wrap this up!

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for…

…Ace and Marino in Ace's Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield. Both of them have their 
heads sticking out so that they can see. Marino has a wad of gum in his mouth.

HIGH ANGLE

The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up Route One. Ace's Bel-Aire 
right in the middle.

MARINO (O.S.)
 

hey Ace?

ACE (O.S.)
 

Yeah, Dan?

MARINO (O.S.)
 

Got any more gum?

CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM - DAY

The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress. Marino is in uniform warming up. Emilio is 
drooling at the cheerleaders. Ace and Melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the 
awesome spectacle.

Some fireworks go off around the tank. A  marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a 
helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
 

Ladies and gentlemen, the Miami
Dolphins are proud to welcome back
to BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, our
beloved mascot and star of the
halftime show…

ANGLE ON

The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
 

Snowflake!!

As the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing 
spectacular flips, they kiss.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the 
foreground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move.

Just as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and 
shoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious.

ACE
 

You idiot! Do you know what
you've done?!

The giant eagle head looks up at Ace.

MASCOT
 

Huh?

Ace grabs him.

ACE
 

You just cost me ten thousand
bucks, Polly!

MASCOT
 

Yeah Blow me.

ACE
 

REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!!

PULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot 
of finger pointing.

Emilio stops his leering to check out what's going on.

The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release.

ANNOUNCER
 

The National Football League would
now like to offer a special thank
you to the man who rescued Dan
Marino and our beloved
Snowflake…

On the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back.

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
 

A great humanitarian, and lover of
all animals… Mr. Ace Ventura!

Ace is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head.

The image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he 
looks into camera with his fist raised.

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm

             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

             Her favorite pastimes were riding

             him that.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --

             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red

                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for

             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.

                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Those are the Shrieking Eels.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             We're past that, Grandpa.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

treading water.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18.


A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.


And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25.


THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           29.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           48.


VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           51.


BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.


                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54.


Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           55.


THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

                         GRANDFATHER
             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66.


                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.


                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.


                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

                                            CUT TO:

A DIAL

with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50."
Rugen goes to it.

                         RUGEN
             This being our first try, I'll
             use the lowest setting.

And he turns the dial to "1".

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens
the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

WESTLEY

and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the
chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes
from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as
we finally

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and
pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

                         RUGEN
             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --

in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries.

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

HUMPERDINCK

in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all
over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in
the doorway.

             Yellin.

             Sire.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Any word from Westley?

THE PRINCE AND YELLIN

turning to her in the doorway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Too soon, my angel. Patience.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

                         HUMPERDINCK

             Try ruling the world sometime.

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

                                            CUT TO:

AN EMPTY ALEHOUSE IN THE THIEVES' QUARTER

Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while FEZZIK spoons him some
stew.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

                                            CUT TO:

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO
                  (he is possessed by
                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS

-- strewn with maps, etc. Yellin enters, and kneels.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharpening his dagger)
             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
             marry. Tomorrow morning, your men
             will escort us to Florin Channel
             where every ship in my armada
             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN
                  (bows, exits)

                         BUTTERCUP
             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart
             full of fear.

             Westley and I are joined by the
             bonds of love. And you cannot
             track that. Not with a thousand
             bloodhounds. And you cannot break
             it. Not with a thousand swords.
             And when I say you are a coward,
             that is only because you are the
             slimiest weakling ever to crawl
             the earth.

WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing
CLERGYMAN imaginable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103.


Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.


                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123.


As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.

             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

          EXT. VIETNAM -- DAY

          A HUEY COBRA in slow motion, crests an impossibly
          beautiful jungle ridge, flying low and straight at us.

          INSIDE THE COBRA
          A GUNNER sprays fire down at unseen anti-aircraft. All
          that can be see on the ground are whizzing TRACERS flying
          up at the chopper.

          

          

          

          
          "Tropic Thunder 4.
          The chopper skims the treetops heading toward a hot LZ...

          EXT.,, HOT LZ -- DAY

          As the Cobra comes in hard, about TWENTY INFANTRYMEN are
          emerging from the tree-line, in a chaotic fire fight with
          twice as many VC SOLDIERS.
          As the. chopper tries to land, the gunner tosses a couple
          of grenades behind the Americans, sending about ten VC
          flying. But the bulk of the platoon is getting GUNNED
          DOWN by the enemy.
          A. heavy set grunt, FATS, looking like he is in great
          pain, is'running full speed for the chopper, taking fire
          from all over.
          Fats looks a 'lot like JEFF PORTNOY, star of ."Doody For
          Dinner".
          BROOKLYN, an.18 year-old cherry from Brooklyn, is also on
          the move, towards the.chopper...Clutching his thick black
          glasses, and a. map, and triangulating coordinates, he' is
          frantically trying to call in an air strike on his radio
          backpack. A GRENADE EXPLODES ten feet away knocking him
          on his ass.
          He gets up, shaken, just in time to be BAYONETED. through
          the stomach by a VC SOLDIER...
          The VC soldier turns around just in time to be machine-
          gunned down-5y MOTOWN who has all sorts of stomizd
          shit" on his fatigues, an ace of spades in his helmet,
          along with some graffiti scrawl that reads "and God
          spoke" including cut-off sleeves that reveal his
          impressive pipes. He, is a 'bad muthaf.ucka.

          MOTOWN
          That's for Brooklyn, Muthafucka!
          Underneath the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed
          out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his M-16
          with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower.
          It does.
          Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him
          over his shoulder, Brooklyn's shirt is blown open
          revealing his entrails...in shock, he clutches his liver
          in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back
          in his body...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 5.
          FATS heaves Brooklyn onto the floor of the still-airborne
          chopper just as it gets low enough, and returns to
          firing. He unleashes a hailstorm of lead at the
          approaching VC...

          OSIRIS

          FATS! GET YOUR ASS ON THIS CHOPPER NOW!

          LET'S MOVE!

          4 41
          FATS ignores him and continueb firing. MOTOWN comes
          running up to the chopper...

          OSIRIS (CONT'D)

          confirmed! This place is gonna be toast
          in about thirty seconds!
          Osiris turns on Motown, pulling his .45 in the midst of
           the mayhem. He pushes it up into Motown's neck.

          OSIRIS

          FOUR LEAF IS DEAD MEAT, SOLDIER! AND YOU

          GOT ZERO 0' HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS

          ON THIS CHOPPER BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM!
          Osiris, standing on the skid, motions for the chopper
          pilot to take off.

          Motown looks to Fats,:then reluctantly jumps on the
          chopper...It begins to hover...

          Sarge...
          .We PUSH IN ON BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his
          head. Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked
          finger...

          BROOKLYN
          It's him. It's Four Leaf...
          Everyone turns to-see...
          FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN
          from the "Scorcher" trailer, . burst through the treeline,
          half limping, half crawling heroically through the
          massive firefight in SLOW MOTION.
          He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS...
          Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and
          can't believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the
          pilot. I

          OSIRIS

          GO! GO!
          Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs
          the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of
          strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might,
          preventing it from flying away.
          The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues
          his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm,
          providing weak cover for Four Leaf.
          The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about
          ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle
          with the helicopter.
          Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is
          fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn't
          even have a gun...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 7.
          Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at
          Fats... a flash of anger and compassion comes over his
          face.. .
          FOUR"LEAF, Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his
          knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of
          lead...

          OSIRIS

          I HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE

          THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE

          BRINGING BACK TO THIS BIRD.. .COVER ME!
          Weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do
          just that... unleashing lead all around Osiris as he jumps
          out of the chopper like an Apache warrior.
          Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his
          machine gun in cool SLO MO.
          Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four
          Leaf. Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer
          fire ...
          Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf,
          cradling his head. Four Leaf's eyes are glassy, and his
          body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll.

          FOUR LEAF
          Get outta here. I'm worm food, man, you
          dig?

          OSIRIS
          (beginning to cry)
          What, and give up all that California
          pussy you been talking about? Shiiit.
          Someone's gotta show me around L.A...

          FOUR LEAF
          (cracking a bloody smile)
          Shit. . .the only way you're gonna get a
          piece of LA pussy if is you go out to the
          graveyard and dig some up...
          Osiris looks down at Four Leaf's now missing arms...

          OSIRIS
          Well ...y...you better come along and
          bring the shovel...
          He starts to choke up.

          gonna see another sunset.
          (long philosophical beat)
          Why does a man want to pick up sticks
          against another man... 'Stead of usin'
          them sticks. to prop a man up?
          Osiris nods, now crying like a baby... ï¿½4Id Iu I. Igft

          DON'T YOU DIE ON ME FOUR LEAF... .THAT'S AN

          ORDER!!!

          FOUR LEAF
          (beginning to fade)
          Hold my hands... 'cause I got somethin'
          to say...
          Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf's bloody, stringy stumps.
          There's nothing to hold...

          FOUR LEAF
          Are, you holding them?

          OSIRIS_

          (WEEPING)
          Oh, I'm holding them..

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't never been worth a. nothin' in
          this life, and it's kinda late to start
          b e i' a somethin' now. But you... you
          are my... b-b-brother.
          Four Leaf screws.up.his .face and begins to cry--except
          that he can't. He tries again... and can't.. Hescrews
          up his face grotesquely...

          FOUR LEAF
          You are my...
          WE NOW PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are actually on location
          shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW MEMBERS
          watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film
          equipment.
          Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman,
          is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and.
          more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry.
          The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting
          uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head.

          (YES, LAZARUS WAS WHITE AND IRISH IN THE SATAN'S ALLEY
          TRAILER, now he is AFRICAN AMERICAN and speaks with an
          American accent-- IT WILL BE EXPLAINED SOON!)
          The person perhaps most upset about it all is the skinny'
          young British director, DAMIEN DORFMAN. Coiled at the
          monitor and covered in bug bites and sunblock, wet towels
          around his neck, and clearly not made for jungle
          life.. .he' mouths the words "you are my brothers..'." as
          if trying to will the tears from Speedman's dry eyes.

          SPEEDMAN
          (breaking character)
          I'm sorry, can we cut, Damien?
          Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around
          to his cadre of assistants and ADs...
          The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to
          fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going
          on.

          SPEEDMAN
          CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!

          DAMIEN

          (CONFUSED)
          What? What did he say?
          (to 1st AD)
          Play it through! Still rolling!
          Now the extras have stopped fighting -- except for a few
          way far back.

          1ST AD
          Play it through! Still rolling!

          SPEEDMAN
          No! Not still rolling! Cut!
          Damien runs towards Speedman.
          Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star JEFF
          PORTNOY, gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt.

          PORTNOY
          OW, SHIT! I fell right on my ass bone!
          Other "dead" extras begin to hold their heads up and look
          around. Some are amputee stuntmen.

          his bloody "liver" up to hand off to someone.

          SANDUSKY:
          Mr. Dorfman? Are we cutting sir? Cause .I
          think they put w ay too much blood in my
          liver again.

          Damien runs up to Speedman. They are the center of

          up a bank -- Speedman in drag. They yell at each other

          ."Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally
          impaired farm hand who can "talk" to

          many critics called one of the worst

          story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in

          (very serious)
          All I want is to make the real Four Leaf
          here proud. It's his story, he lived it
          and wrote it in his book. That's why
          we're here. But really, I mean, how cah
          we begin to understand what he-- what you
          --went through?
          Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for
          a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only
          two HOOKS.
          Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying
          to "get inside" him as much as possible.

          As far as Redykulous is concerned, you

          is the official beverage on the set of
          Tropic Thunder, as well as my new energy
          bar, the "Bust-A-Nut", with all proceeds
          going to clean up land mines in this
          previously war ravaged area.

          EXT. HOTEL POOL -- DAY


          JULIE
          At a reported budget north of $200
          million, Tropic Thunder could end up
          costing almost as much as the real war!
          But the good news for Damien Dorfman and
          his troops -- the Oscar buzz is already
          starting! So for El News I'm Julie--
          All of a sudden Portnoy, wearing a Tropic Thunder cap all
          askew and surfer shorts with no shirt, bursts out of the
          bushes. He screams wildly and GRABS Julie, who cracks up
          laughing at his "stunt". '

          PORTNOY

          It is the one hotel in the area, and it looks like it has
          been through a war, which it probably has. It has been
          taken over as the Tropic Thunder production headquarters.
          We see a mix of PRODUCTION PEOPLE and HOTEL WORKERS.

          VOICE OF TODD
          We're shutting you down, Dorf.

          INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

          Damien sits behind his desk, looking scared. Vietnam
          photos, maps, and sketches cover the walls. Standing in
          the office are ASSORTED CREW, including Cody and Four
          Leaf, who whittles a stick with his hooks, never looking
          up.

          They are all staring at a speaker phone.

          DAMIEN
          You can't do that Todd.

          VOICE OF TODD I
          Yes we can.. The dailies are not good.

          DAMIEN
          Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good
          movie! Isn't that what they say?

          VOICE OF TODD
          I never heard that saying. Look, Damien.
          Fact: You're. three weeks behind and
          you've been shooting for five days. Fact:
          we greenlit this project at a very
          specific number, a number Walter and I
          could get in bed. with, and fact--.

          (starting to lose it)
          Todd, it really isn't necessary for you
          to,keep saying "fact" before everything.
          It's kind of implied, that if you are
          saying.it--

          VOICE OF TODD
          Alright.. I'm just.trying to keep the
          emotion out of it, so I thought I would
          say."fact" before each fact, so it would
          be less-upsetting -- I

          VOICE OF WALTER
          Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I'm just
          gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a
          second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for
          Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's
          miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds
          like the inmates are running the asylum.

          DAMIEN
          Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if-
          you actually came out here you would see
          that .these actors are--

          VOICE OF TODD
          (loud out of'nowhere)
          The actors didn't blow up the rainforest

          Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young

          HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT
          Sorry.

          It's Chris Michael, he says it's
          important.
          Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony and
          slides the glass door shut.

          Though the hotel is a shambles, the view out on to the

          EXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE

          In stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is
          living, Speedman is in what looks like an Asian
          presidential palace overlooking the ocean.
          SPEEDMAN is standing on the deck, trying hard to hold the,
          phone with his hook hands. "Simple Jack" plays on a flat
          screen inside.

          SPEEDMAN
          Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw
          a little pep talk your way. I know today
          was rough, and you're probably mad at
          yourself for not getting the shots, but
          that's the way these movies go. We all
          boot it from time to time, and today was
          just one of those days. Happens.

          DAMIEN
          (sickly sweet)
          Yes it does. It does. Though I do think
          you have to realize Chris, that you are
          somewhat responsi--

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh, also needed to let you know, and I.
          .know you're like wrapped up with the
          movie, but I really need that new chef
          like we talked about, you know to really 4
          get that super-ripped thing happening.
          This guy is great but all he makes are
          dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked
          out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I

          things ...I'm dealing with bigger issues
          right now Chris --

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah, of course, I just know we talked
          about getting super-super-ripped for that
          starvation sequence
          Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D?
          He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the
          hooks.

          INT. AGENCY OFFICE -- L.A. - DAY

          RICK PECK, head of the Peck Agency, sits in his office,
          overlooking. Los Angeles. He has a headset on.

          PECK.
          Guess what I'm staring at right now?

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN SPEEDMAN AND PECK

          SPEEDMAN
          What?

          PECK
          I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back
          of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful
          living color with the two cute cuddly
          pandas from cuteville. It's insane.

          Tropic Thunder 25.
          We see Pedk is holding a Vanity Fair with an ad on the
          back: it is a picture of Speedman looking earnest,
          holding two baby PANDAS. The caption reads:

          "PANDAS...THEIR SURVIVAL IS NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE"

          PECK
          The credibility factor that the pandas
          give you is priceless, and strangely, if'
          you see this picture, what really strikes
          me is the credibility that you give them.
          I've been getting psychotic feedback all
          day. Hey did you get the basket I sent?
          WE SEE: A survival-themed gift basket in a camouflage
          backpack, There's a satellite phone, camouflage
          sunblock, etc.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah. Thanks.

          PECK
          You sad? What's wrong?

          SPEEDMAN
          No I'm fine. I've just been having a
          tough time over here. They still havn't
          got the TiVo hooked up and... I don't
          know... Lazarus is getting all this Oscar
          buzz already --

          PECK
          Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk
          Lazarus goes and places his entire body
          in some experimental Malaysian dipping
          sauce so he can actually be black, of
          course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to
          what I am telling you. He is clinically
          mentally not right.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah but the way they talk about him. I
          mean, he played a retarded guy and won an
          Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't
          even get a nomination. I don't know, I
          mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my
          "Elf" but with Oscars. Those were your
          exact words.

          I don't believe those were my exact words
          but let's get beyond that to the root of
          this. Remember the moment you chose to do,
          this', and I wanted you to do the ESP
          robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen? And I
          said stay home be happy and you said "no,
          Rick I need to play a real human being"
          and I said "okay" and then I said "are
          you sure?" and you said that you needed
          this-for your soul?

          SPEEDMAN
          Yes but --

          PECK
          Which I totally respected and now you're
          doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move
          on me,..which I love by the-way-- but-you
          said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul
          And-that's why I hate you.. Because you
          were RIGHT. And you're in. the Phuc Long
          fucking Delta,. in the real mud, with-
          leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil

          Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would
          wager, forcing everyone around you to
          rise to your level. Am I right? I mean
          you are over there forcing a bunch of
          PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and.
          become a platoon. And it hurts. Am I
          right?
          Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this

          SPEEDMAN
          Yeah. You are right.

          PECK
          Alright, that's what.I thought. Now get
          to work genius soldier. I'll handle the
          .TiVo.
          Peck hangs up abruptly.

          ON SPEEDMAN
          Speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts. it
          down. He ponders Rick's words as he gets caught up
          watching the end scene of "SIMPLE JACK" on his TV.
          He has forgotten Damien is on the other line.

          Finally, after a few moments of listening to this, Damien
          explodes. He throws the phone on the ground and jumps up
          and down on it. He notices the crew staring at him. He
          tries to look as if that just didn't happen.
          He opens the sliding glass, and heads straight to the
          door. He continues walking through his office, out into
          the main offices. He motions for his assistant to join
          him.

          torches,, buffets. PLAYBOY PLAYMATE DANCERS circa 1967 are
          dancing on a deck in front of a banner that reads "ONE

          with the dancers and starts doing a striptease.

          ENTRANCE TO THE DECK
          Damien walks in, watching this scene from Caligula going
          down. He looks in a deep funk.
          Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with
          a thud in front of Damien.

          Kevin Sandusky ("Brooklyn" from the movie) comes up to

          Uh, no. I think--
          But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug

          SANDUSKY
          Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find
          you. I know this is a party, but this
          afternoon after work I was breaking down
          my M-16, and I have to say, in the night
          watch scene, a minute and a half is a
          pretty short amount of time to assemble
          it.

          Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge
          opportunity. To be working with all these
          great actors, and you.

          DAMIEN
          You're the only one who auditioned.
          You're the only one who did the two week
          boot camp, Sandusky.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird.
          Wasn't the point that we were all

          We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of
          food.
          Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a
          spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS

          Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was
          smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was
          retarded. So you can afford to play
          retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky
          tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there.

          LAZARUS
          (with 'a chuckle)
          Are you serious? Everyone knows you
          don't ever go fully retarded!

          How do you mean?
          Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.

          Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT

          "Being There", infantile? Yes.
          Retarded? No.
          He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder.

          You went full retard, man. You never go 14
          full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean
          Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard.
          Went home empty handed.
          Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be
          so stupid?

          LAZARUS
          (cruelly, driving it home)
          But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could
          be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose
          the hook hands though... cripples don't
          give the Academy wood either.

          (DAZED)
          Oh.
          Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass
          and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately
          holding the spring,roll in his hook.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE,OF THE ROOM
          Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high
          strung than ever. He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by
          his posse and a CAMERA CREW.

          DAMIEN
          Redykulous... I need to talk to you.

          REDYKULOUS
          What up, money.

          DAMIEN
          (in a hushed tone, aware of
          the cameras)
          We're having a cast meeting, right now
          We need to come together as a unit --
          The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien
          uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout
          the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.

          REDYKULOUS
          Uh-huh...
          Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i
          started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch
          style camera move...
          DAMIEN i
          Do you mind if we step away for a moment?

          REDYKULOUS
          From what?
          Damien tries to indicate the crew.

          DAMIEN
          (whispering even lower now)
          From the...uh...you know... .this area..

          REDYKUL:OUS
          Oh, I see...sure
          They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire
          camera crew follows.

          DAMIEN
          Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the
          cameras.
           you understand?. Away from
          (indicating the crew)
          them...

          REDYKULOUS
          No.

          DAMIEN
          What?

          REDYKULOUS
          No. I can't do that. If Redykulous
          steps away from the cameras then my
          .people don't get to see the real
          Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly
          Redykulous".

          DAMIEN
          Well this is about work ...my show so to.
          .speak. Do you understand?

          REDYKULOUS
          I guess. But not really. Your show and
          my show are the same thing. This is gonna
          help your show, trust me.

          dictate your revenue streams all the way
          through DVD release, pay per view,
          etcetera.
          Damien thinks this over for a second. It does sort of
           make sense. He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k I , 1 '144%
          for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from
          them...

          DAMIEN
          Excuse me, everyone! If I could have
          your attention!
          Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a
          couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.

          DAMIEN
          Sorry to break up the party, but I just
          wanted to call your attention to a cast
          meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of
          the film depends on it!

          (UNRAVELING)
          Not to mention my entire bloody life!
          Damien in a final cry of frustration, SMASHES a bottle on
          the bar. He succeeds only in cutting his hand.

          DAMIEN

          GODFUCKITI SHIT!
          Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's
          shoulder. He steps to the fore.

          "When... we.'.. put... aside... our...

          know it's just a book for. kids, but I
          think it applies to.making a movie as
          well. 'Course... I know a lot of the

          When a herd loses its way, the shepherd

          Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing
          eerily in the bushes by the sand.

          FOUR LEAF
          You don't know which way is up, do you
          private`? You couldn't find a dixie
          coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your
          prick. and showin' you the way...
          Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant.
          Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes.
          Damien's eyes widen in fear.

          can cleave that mountain to make the
          valley, and an army of ants can fell the
          mighty buffalo.

          He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his
          cigarette...

          FOUR LEAF
          There's a place. About a hundred clicks
          from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the
          jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties.
          Nothing but triple canopy jungle and
          cockroaches the size of melons.
          Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his
          weirdness.

          Rig up your documentary cameras'in that
          jungle, give me and Cody a few of those
          smoke bombs and some charges and we could
          light up the jungle so those lily-dick
          actors would think they were in the
          middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them
          thinking they're getting shot at, and
          you'll have your movie.
          Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as
          though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished
          mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis.

          FOUR LEAF
          You must put them.under your thumb the
          way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR
          control.

          I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my
          total control... finally. I could shoot
          the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty.
          Away from their pampered pussy posses and

          Cody is piloting. Damien and Four Leaf are in the back
          sitting, across from Speedman, Portnoy, Redyk and Lazarus
          and Sandusky.
          We move across the faces of the actors, all in
          brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except
          for Sandusky who seems excited.
          Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent

          So, uh, any idea how long we'll be gone?
          Because I left most of my... vitamins
          back at the hotel.
          The other actors chime in with similar concerns,
          regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities,
          etc... '

          They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is
          undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien
          sprawling onto hire.

          crack platoon.

          As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts.
          trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.' The
          Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving.
          All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that
          has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of
          an old rusted outâ€¢'downed chopper.
          All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who

          stows it down the front of his pants.

          Damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye.

          DAMIEN
          Okay, girls... now that I have your
          attention, I will tell you fuckfaces what
          we're doing here. You are no longer
          actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a

          Congratulations. You've just landed in
          "the shit". Your objective is to head
          north and liberate the village at D'ang
          Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf"
          gets himself captured, at which point you
          rescue him, at which point we will
          chopper you home. We will also be
          rigging this entire valley of death with
          hidden cameras so that every glorious
          moment gets on film. And believe me it
          WILL be glorious. If it looks real,
          chances are good it probably is. You
          wanted to be actors? You wanted to
          occupy the skin of another human being?
          Get ready to occupy the skin of a
          terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded
          by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole.

          gets home until we get the shots!
          (loud and confident)
          Now... let's'put the greatest war movie
          ever in the can!
          With that, Damien marches toward the treeline and'steps
          on a dormant LAND MINE left sleeping for decades., BLOWING'

          HIM TO BITS.
          The group stands absolutely stock still for several long
          beats until...

          SPEEDMAN
          Whoa.

          EXT. JUNGLE. -- A HALF MILE AWAY

          A group of about SIX ASIAN GUERILLA FIGHTERS, well armed
          and scary looking,,. notice the sound of the explosion.
          They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language.
          One of them grabs a radio:

          GUERILLAS

          (SUBTITLES)
          < We have heard an explosion, in the
          northern sector.>

          A UNKNOWN VOICE
          (crackling over walkie
          talkie),
          .
          They lock and load, heading towards the actors...

          EXT. JUNGLE -- A.HILLTOP CLEARING

          Four Leaf scans the horizon while. Cody sets up high-tech
          equipment, including monitors and cameras and detonation
          devices.

          

          

          

          

          I
          Tropic Thunder 41.

          CODY
          So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives
          us the go ahead, we'ï¿½ust their cherry
          with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha
          till they come running right at, us, then
          a good of fashioned firefight,
          maintaining our distance.
          Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle,
          looking almost lost.

          CODY
          I been meaning to tell ya the whole
          shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest
          fans. Your book was kinda my "Catcher in
          the Rye". It inspired me to become a gyro
          man.
          Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic
          stare.

          CODY
          I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I
          never was in the service, but for me
          blowing shit up in a war films is sort of
          my way of paying tribute to the real
          deal. And you sir, are the real deal.
          Nothing.

          CODY
          Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm
          you carry? Looks to me like a--

          FOUR LEAF
          (very scary)
          I don't know what it's called. I just
          know the sound it makes when it takes a
          man's life.
          Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.

          CODY
          Ok, we're ready to rock and roll.
          (to walkie-talkie)
          Damien, come in. Cameras are up,
          ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires
          and light the fires on your say so.

          Tropic Thunder 42.

          EXT. JUNGLE - THE ACTORS

          WE are close on the seemingly broken.walkie talkie,.which
          has heard none of this. We PULL BACK to reveal the guys,
          staring at Damien's corpse in total shock. All except
          Speedman, who looks on with a smirk.

          PORTNOY
          I think he's like... dead.

          SPEEDMAN:
          (with a chuckle)
          Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice,
          wherever you're hiding!

          REDYKULOUS
          I don't think he's hiding.. I think he
          just died!
          Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse.
          pulls a wrist into frame.

          SANDUSKY
          He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head.
          He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.

          SANDUSKY
          Must've been one of those Claymore mines.
          This old Jungle must.be full of them.,

          REDYKUZOUS
          You bet your ass it is. That's why a
          percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are
          helpin' solve the problem!
          Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle.
          Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the
          hell?
          Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent
          older brother.

          SPEEDMAN
          C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what
          .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of
          the Nam! He's trying to get in our
          heads!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 43.

          GUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE
          They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys
          from about thirty feet.

          SPEEDMAN
          That whole "life and death" speech in the
          chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do
          you think all that "playing God" was
          about?
          The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief --
          except Lazarus.

          LAZARUS
          Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is
          dead!!
          Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.

          SPEEDMAN
          Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor
          here, but, no offense, I've done a lot
          mote effects driven event films, and I
          think I can spot a prop body.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          The LEAD guerilla signals for all his guys to hold their
          fire and pick their targets...

          ON THE ACTORS
          Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on Damien's body
          crackles to life:

          CODY (ON WALKIE)
          -- I repeat, we are now go for mission!

          DAMIE--
          The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up,
          showing it to the guys. See?

          SPEEDMAN

          (SMIRKING)
          Alright, can we start the scene now? Or
          do you need a formal invitation?!
          (checking the list)
          Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day. Ambush.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 44.
          Speedman closes his eyes, taking a second to get into
          character. He opens them, and grabs. his gun and creeps
          towards the bushes, stealthily..

          SPEEDMAN
          (as Four Leaf)
          I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats.
          The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM
          "c'mon!" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means...

          SPEEDMAN
          I said, I got a baaad feeling on this
          one, Brooklyn...
          Oh! He's acting!
          Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking.
          stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie.
          Swinging his gun unpredictably.

          ON THE GUERILLAS
          They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the
          other side of the. trees... they back off as. he waves his
          gun...

          BACK ON THE ACTORS'

          SANDUSKY
          (-as Brooklyn)
          Me too, cap'n.

          (BEAT)
          Hey, cap?: If.I told you something,
          something kinda personal, you wouldn't
          think I was crazy, right?

          SPEEDMAN
          Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy
          Brooklyn...

          SANDUSKY
          Well,. if I told you that I, I never
          actually, well, been with a girl...you
          wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer
          .or nothin'... would you.?

          SPEEDMAN
          .Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a
          queer.

          Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too:

          REDYKULOUS
          (acting really "black guy"

          SCARED)
          Sh...sh...shit ...When I get back to the
          world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece
          of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it
          till I broke its back.

          PORTNOY
          The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in
          your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind
          slurpin' on a little of that --

          SPEEDMAN
          That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you
          worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a
          fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't
          gonna let Charlie...
          Lazarus can't handle it anymore.

          LAZARUS
          What the FUCK is wrong with you people?!
          Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back.
          He addresses the treeline.

          SPEEDMAN
          Sorry Damien! Back to one... action!
          (he gets back in character)
          Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta

          LOTTA--

          LAZARUS
          Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED!
          Speedman sighs, annoyed.

          SPEEDMAN
          How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some
          of us are taking this seriously.
          Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he
          becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive
          transformation -- Everything except for his skin color
          returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.

          LAZARUS
          (Heavy Irish)
          Jaysus! There isn't going to be any
          movie, ya gobshite!

          LAZARUS (cont'd)
          Damien is dead, Speedman. Yes,_the show
          must go on, but this is feckin' madness.

          PORTNOY
          (re: Lazarus transformation) i
          Wow. That was really cool.

          THE GUERILLAS
          Are watching this, poised to attack.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped
          something.
          He mimes picking something , off, the ground.

          SPEEDMAN
          It's called your character. Don't worry,
          I won't tell the Academy!
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have
          seized the moment.
          The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for
          Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and
          debris kicks up all around him.

          SPEEDMAN
          You happy now? We're out of position for
          the effect! Am I the only one who read
          .the script?! This is the ambush!
          A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks
          of wood and shrapnel everywhere.

          SANDUSKY
          I think they're really shooting at us!

          SPEEDMAN
          What are you guys worried about? These
          guys are pros. The unions would tear
          them a new ass-if any of us got hurt.
          The actors stay down, looking scared.

          SPEEDMAN
          Come on, you guys! Let's use this!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 47.
          No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone.
          Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and
          doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment
          of absurd action style maneuvers throughout.
          Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and
          join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what
          the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen
          enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES.

          ON THE GUERRILLAS
          Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of
          the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their
          screams, they drop back...

          GUERILLA LEADER
          
          The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up
          RPGs...

          EXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING

          Four Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear
          the firefight, but, Cody can't.

          FOUR LEAF
          Hear that?
          Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.

          CODY
          What? I still can't get Damien on the
          radio. I bet he forgot how to use the
          Walkie again. What do you say we get a
          little... pro-active?
          Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.

          BACK ON THE ACTORS
          Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to
          blow them to kingdom come with RPGs.
          But before the guerillas have a chance--

          

          

          

          

          I
          t' Tropic Thunder 48.

          ON CODY
          He pushes down the plunger...

          ON THE GUERILLAS

          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!!
          Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is
          going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the
          shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat.

          EXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING

          Cody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with
          binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle.

          CODY
          Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!.
          Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring
          straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine
          guns pointed straight at them.

          CODY
          Oh shit.

          FOUR LEAF
          Oh yeah.
          And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of
          consciousness...

          EXT. JUNGLE -- THE ACTORS

          Speedman motions for everyone to "cease fire".

          SPEEDMAN

          (PUMPED)
          Aaaaand... CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That's
          the trailer 'right there!

          REDYKULOUS
          That was some sick shit! I wasn't even
          thinking bout the camera!
          The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all
          around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the
          jungle, sensing that someone was out there.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 49.

          SANDUSKY'
          So what do we do now?
          Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.

          SPEEDMAN
          Damien said to head north. I'm guessing
          they've got more of these "battles" and
          Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way.
          (into it)
          Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang
          Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a
          lot of clicks to cover!
          Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of
          jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little
          lost.

          SANDUSKY
          Uh...Sir, isn't it that way?
          Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances
          down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up
          now.

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...

          SANDUSKY
          (can't believe it)
          Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.

          SPEEDMAN
          Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it-
          to-it!
          Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly,
          brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING

          It is a large, secret heroin processing facility,
          surrounded by barbed wire fencing. It is in a clearing
          in the jungle, by a small river.
          There's a GUARD TOWER overlooking a main gate, which
          leads into a big open courtyard area. The main structure
          is a low, concrete military-looking building.
          It's all populated with tough-looking, well-armed
          badasses.

          CODY AND FOUR LEAF, both hog-tied and unconscious, are
          marched through the courtyard, and into a building.

          INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER

          We are behind the back of the person who is in charge. In
          front of him, we see workers busily manufacturing tar
          heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere.
          A cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired.
          The Lieutenant steps to the fore -- this is BYONG. He's
          badly shaken.

          BYONG
          
          The Unseen Leader shakes. his head.

          EXT. BAMBOO FOREST -- DAY

          The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of
          bamboo. They look exhausted -- except for Speedman, who
          always manages to look like.a.movie star.

          PORTNOY
          So... we're just supposed to keep
          walking?

          SPEEDMAN
          We'll see some action soon enough. And
          try to stay in character. We're on
          camera..

          Whenever Damien decides it's time, I
          guess.

          PORTNOY
          When's that?

          SPEEDMAN
          I don't know. That's the whole point.
          Damien wants us tired and confused.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for
          those objectives.
          Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus
          notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.

          SPEEDMAN
          Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break,
          but be on the lookout for anything.
          Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break
          or not.
          Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled.
          Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take
          a leak. Lazarus then watches him go.
          Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears
          something rustle next to him.

          LAZARUS (O.S.)
          Psst. Hey.
          Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close
          to him.

          LAZARUS
          Speedman is watching. I don't have much
          time. I don't really need to piss. I
          need to talk to you. You went to the
          boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read
          that map?

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah...

          LAZARUS
          Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That
          hoor's melt really thinks this is a
          movie. And he's got the lot of ya
          convinced.

          SANDUSKY
          You saying you don'tithink they're
          filming us?

          I

          LAZARUS
          Of course not! It's only a matter of
          time before he walks us into more mines
          or more of whoever the hell was shootin',
          at us. That muppet's going to get us all
          killed. I need to convince everyone.to
          turn around, but I .can't do it without
          the map. You're the only one who can
          read it. Can I count on you?

          SANDUSKY
          Well, yeah, I.guess. But

          LAZARUS
          Good man, Good man.
          Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing,
          shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group.
          Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to?
          Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee
          again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see
          Speedman, right next to him.

          SPEEDMAN
          I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't
          need to pee. I need to talk to you.
          Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat
          and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create
          a red pee.stream.

          SPEEDMAN
          Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and.
          he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all
          of us. The men respect you, because you
          went to boot camp and rehearsal.
          (patting his shoulder)
          And you're pretty handy with that map. I
          need you on my side, Kyle.

          talk to some of the Dreamworks
          brass... there'll probably be a Teen
          Choice award in it for you. You have
          that potential.

          SANDUSKY
          Well, I --

          SPEEDMAN
          Good man. Good man.
          Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.

          EXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER

          The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown
          path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth.

          SPEEDMAN
          If we stay on this trajectory we should
          be reaching the village any minute now.
          At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating
          from Portnoy.

          SPEEDMAN
          Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead
          of us...

          (SICK)
          No... its just that I don't feel so hot...
          I left my medication at the hotel.

          (to himself, snickering)
          Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those
          "meds" for my own self.
          Lazarus moves up to Speedman.

          LAZARUS
          Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a
          village don't you think we would have hit
          it by now?

          SPEEDMAN
          Quit your carping, we're right where
          we're supposed to be!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 54.
          WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of
          frame...
          We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW

          MOVING RIVER.

          LAZARUS
          .(laughing)
          Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that
          map?
          S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.

          SPEEDMAN
          Yes! There is! Its just a little more'
          down to the... lefty-down part from the:
          village.
          (checking the scene list)
          Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat
          Raid at the end of the second act.

          LAZARUS
          I don't see a "Sampan" boat!

          SPEEDMAN
          Any second now one should come by.
          Alright men, into the water!
          Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water.
          They all hold their rifles above their heads.

          need to quit faffin' about and turn.
          around NOW! And...
          Lazarus grabs Sandusky.

          LAZARUS
          Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you,
          Sandusky?
          Kevin is caught, not sure what to d

          SPEEDMAN

          Now Speedman grabs him.

          LAZARUS
          No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves,
          a pretty shite one.
          The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels'
          himself.

          SPEEDMAN
          THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only
          chance!

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until
          they send help! Or maybe try to get back
          to the hotel.

          SPEEDMAN
          Help from where! Need I remind you that
          Damien's orders were to --
          (right at Lazarus)
          --stay in character.
          (to the guys)
          Now, I already have an international box
          office presence, but for some of you, I'm
          guessing you might not want to screw this
          movie up!
          This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't
          believe it.

          SPEEDMAN
          .okay...C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go
          get those Viet Congs!
          Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.

          LAZARUS
          Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet
          Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey,
          if you're so sure of yourself, why don't
          you let Kelvin have a look at the map?!
          Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get
          in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough
          guy.

          SPEEDMAN

          Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a

          supposed to be doing this:

          Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not

          pussing out on me? We are supposed to be

          No one is "pussing out." They just
          prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can
          you get'us back to the landing zone
          without the map?

          SANDUSKY
          It might be tricky, but maybe.

          Lazarus. Everyone follows him.
          Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his
          head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle
          with both hands over his head.

          BREATH)
          And when I give my acceptance speech,
          I'll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for
          staying out of that scene. And come Oscar
          night, we'll see who feels a little "full
          retard"!
          He reaches the other side of the river.

          shoot it alone.

          We slowly push in on a lone figure silhouetted against
          the purple sky, trudging along the top of a trail to
          nowhere.

          CLOSER
          Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted. He is
          tired, lonely and hungry. The jungle is making all sorts
          of terrifying noises. Finally he stops and regards the
          treeline.

          one good part for a black man in this
          movie and they gave it to a white guy.

          little from his common sense approach.
          From now on we walk Indian style,
          footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you
          take first position.
          He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and
          pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look.

          now becoming full on RAIN.
          He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick.
          Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a
          tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He
          then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents
          into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule.
          He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A
          rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and
          begins to stalk his prey.
          Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of.
          fur...
          Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness,
          and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is

          He stumbles back against a tree.
          Suddenly we hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and -
          frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the

          peroxide and some lime. Your gonna wanna

          gonna be a bitch... that's normal...
          Speedman'nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a

          PIANO. WIRE BEING SLIPPED AROUND HIS NECK...
          Suddenly, he'is being choked.-He drops the phone, gasping
          for.air...

          RICK (O.S.)

          calling that publicist right now, the one
          J Lo hired when she was'hammered and

          A guerilla shoots the phone. They quickly tie Speedman.up
          and whisk him'off into the jungle.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND -- DAWN

          Speedman is being led through the courtyard in:shackles.
          He looks up to the guard towers.
          There are security cameras everywhere. In Speedman''s
          mind, movie cameras. He nods, into it.

          SPEEDMAN
          (under his breath)
          Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it

          slatted window, watching...

          CODY
          Where are we?

          FOUR LEAF
          In a detention hut. And they got
          Speedman...

          FOUR LEAF'S P.O.V. --
          A guard shoves Speedman hard with a rifle butt. Speedman
          over "acts" the pain.

          BACK ON CODY AND FOUR LEAF
          Cody gets up, starting to freak out

          CODY
          What? Why? We gotta get outta here! Are
          they gonna kill us?
          Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his
          hooks.

          FOUR LEAF
          Pull it together private! Shut your trap
          before you get us killed! You understand
          me , lilydick? !
          Cody backs off, still scared.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER

          Speedman is in a windowless hut, his feet and hands tied
          to a chair.
          There are security cameras in the corners of the room,
          which Speedman continually plays to.
          Byong stands across from him, watching him calmly.

          A

          BYONG
          What were you doing in our poppy fields?

          SPEEDMAN

          (CONFUSED)

          Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing.
          a little easier?

          SPEEDMAN
          You bastard.

          BYONG
          What? just thought you might like.
          some...

          SPEEDMAN
          Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh.

          He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into
          the back wall.
          Beat.

          SPEEDMAN
          (under his breath)
          You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE --.DAY

          A pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman
          into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge
          of-a marsh.
          He looks around, impressed with the production design. He
          looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He
          turns it on.

          SPEEDMAN
          May God protect you from the mighty arm
          of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My
          men will seek you out and mete. out a
          cruel justice!-
          Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. RICE PADDY -- DAY

          Looking up we see a circle of faces. Our guys, looking
          down on something awful.. . .that thing is:

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 65.
          PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt

          SANDUSKY
          I think he's dead.
          A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy.

          REDYKULOUS
          No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled

          44M
          like that all night.

          LAZARUS
          What's wrong with him?

          PORTNOY

          (LYING)
          Nothing! Probably just the beginning
          stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever.
          More bad noises.

          PORTNOY
          If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½? I
          think it might subside in a little bit...
          No one touches him.

          LAZARUS
          Alright. Sandusky?
          Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?

          SANDUSKY
          What?

          LAZARUS
          You and Redykulous are gonna have to
          carry Portnoy. God help you.
          He marches off.

          SANDUSKY
          God help me?

          REDYKULOUS
          God help him that bitch ever find his
          blackface minstrel show ass alone with me
          in the real world.
          Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up
          Portnoy on a make shift stretcher.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 66.

          EXT. HILLTOP

          Our guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift
          stretcher.
          They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous
          spots something.
          ''I , I n n4ï¿½N11

          REDYKULOUS
          Look!
          From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the
          ground.

          SANDUSKY
          SHH! Everybody down!
          The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them.
          He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.

          I

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is the Flaming Dragon compound...

          ON THE GUYS

          " LAZARUS
          Fook me! I knew it!

          -SANDUSKY
          Knew what?

          LAZARUS
          "EXT. P.O.W. PRISON CAMP -- DAY"! Oranges
          and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements.
          Speedman was right. We 'are shooting the
          movie.
          Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking...

          LAZARUS
          (to himself),
          How could I be so stupid.

          SANDUSKY
          I don't think so... . looks to me like some
          sort of heroin processing plant. Look at
          the cooking vats, and the guards.
          Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 67.

          LAZARUS
          How do you know all,this?

          SANDUSKY
          It was a long trip. I read the in-flight
          magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle,
          the biggest drug producer in the world.
          Uh-oh.

          BINOCULAR POV
          It is SPEEDMAN, who is being dipped in and out of the
          water in his bamboo cage, while a bunch of guards stand
          around and laugh. Whenever he comes up for air, he is

          YELLING:

          SPEEDMAN

          CUT!1
          (into the water, then out)

          CUT1!

          BACK TO 'SCENE

          LAZARUS
          What do you see?

          SANDUSKY
          It doesn't look good.
          Lazarus grabs the binoculars.

          LAZARUS
          Sweet Mother of Jaysus.
          Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND!
          A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at
          them, firing automatic weapons...
          The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the
          hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his
          stretcher for dear life...
          In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when
          suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!

          PORTNOY

          HELP! GUYS! WAIT!
          REDYKULOUS stops and turns around and runs back to him,
          heroically pulling him out. BUT...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 68.
          There is more fire coming all around. He gives up,
          reverses tactics, and starts KICKING PORTNOY IN THE
          CHEST, trying to KICK HIM INTO THE HOLE !

          11

          PORTNOY
          Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?!
          He screams in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears
          into the'hole. REDYKULOUS whistles for the guys to join
          him, and they all pile into the hole.

          IN, THE HOLE
          Totally black... . they huddle, trying to muffle their
          heavy breathing...

          ABOVE. THE HOLE
          The guerillas all frantically look around for the guys.
          No sign of them. One of them signals for them to keep
          moving.

          HOLE
          Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area. Sandusky
          lights a match. Portnoy is weeping in pain.

          SANDUSKY
          Must be one of those underground tunnels.
          The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f
          must have found one of the entrances,:.
          Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.

          PORTNOY
          My ass...I think I took one in the ass...

          SANDUSKY
          Lemme see...
          Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove
          his pants... All the guys recoil in horror.

          REDYKULOUS

          AWW JEEESUS MAN!

          SANDUSKY
          How did it get infected so fast?
          More ad libs of disgust...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 69.

          SANDUSKY'
          Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell,
          but I have to take my finger and see how
          deep the slug is, and if I can dig it
          out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his
          hand...
          Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera.

          I

          PORTNOY
          Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it
          out! That's not the bullet hole. The
          bullet hole is over here!
          It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at
          the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust.

          SANDUSKY
          OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're
          gonna be fine.

          EXT. BAMBOO CAGE -- DAY

          Speedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage. He is covered
          in a few leeches. Byong appears with his usual cadre of
          guards. He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him
          out of the cage.

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON HQ - COURTYARD

          Byong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard. A
          HUSH falls over the soldiers.
          They begin to part, as someone very important is
          arriving.
          Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY,
          no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer.
          He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN.
          He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in
          a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off,
          revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a
          flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a
          rat. He holds a stick.

          SPEEDMAN

          Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out
          of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick
          and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN...

          He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils.

          INT. TRAN'S QUARTERS -- DAY

          Speedman is now seated in a comfortable, ornate chair,
          though his feet and hands are still bound. Tran and
          Byong and a few cohorts, stand across from him,
          whispering.

          We love the tale of this man, Simple

          Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a
          battered VHS BOX OF SIMPLE JACK. Speedman looks lovingly
          at it.

          TRAN
          We do not have many luxury here. Simple

          Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It's a

          No, I mean it is great to.be nominated,..
          if you are, or that's what I hear.
          Whatever. It's a popularity contest.
          It's totally political, you have to lobby
          for like a year for it...

          TRAM
          Is it possible to.have picture?

          SPEEDMAN
          Oh, sure, absolutely.
          Speedman tries to throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs
          the arm., and twists it back. Speedman shrieks in pain.

          TRAN
          You mustn't touch me.
          The guard snaps the picture.

          ABODYGUARD
          That came out really good.

          GREAT--
          Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt.
          Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers.

          SPEEDMAN

          Tran stands over him, screaming into his face:

          Sand}asky slowly lifts his head out, surveying the
          territory. It looks clear. He drops back down.

          INT. HOLE -- DUSK

          The actors look miserable. Portnoy-looks.like his face is
          going to fall off

          SANDUSKY
          It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I
          say we stay in here till it's dark.

          REDYKULOUS
          I can't believe this is how it ends for
          Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum
          recording artist., Shit.

          PORTNOY
          (shivering and wheezing)
          I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not
          gonna make.it...

          SANDUSKY
          Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're
          out'here. They'll be looking for us.
          Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And
          no one else knows but us.

          LAZARUS
          That's right. So here's the plan.
          Everyone leans forward expectantly.

          LAZARUS
          We sneak out of here, make our way back
          to the hotel and once we're safe, we
          alert the government of Speedman's
          situation.

          REDYKULOUS
          Sounds good.

          SANDUSKY
          Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just
          gonna leave him here?

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 75.

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, and I don't wanna spend another
          minute getting the full on smell'o vision
          in this hole with his stinky ass.
          Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks
          horrified.
          SANDUSKY Au II4
          WAIT! Look, I don't think I've met a more
          wildly self involved human than Speedman,
          but you're just gonna leave him here? I
          mean, come on. He's a person, guys.
          These drug lords are killers. I mean,
          they eat their enemies. We leave him
          alone now, he doesn't have a chance in
          hell.

          LAZARUS,
          That tosser is in there because of his
          own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned,
          he brought it on himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Besides, how could we possibly rescue
          him? Get real, Sandusky, we don't know
          what the fuck we doing out here.

          SANDUSKY
          We've gotten this far. Look, we're making
          a movie about one of the greatest rescues
          ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean,
          those guys weren't superheroes! They
          were just put in extra-ordinary
          circumstances, and they rose to the
          occasion.

          PORTNOY
          Yeah, but they were trained soldiers.
          They knew how to take care of themselves.

          SANDUSKY
          And we don't? They believed they could do
          it. They believed in each other. Look,
          I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

          (BEAT)
          I mean, some of us might not come back.

          REDYKULOUS
          You mean, like, not on the same flight?
          Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what
          he meant.

          you,.â€¢but you're gonna have to kick some
          time, and it might as well be now.
          (he turns to Lazarus)
          Kirk, I've always admired you as an
          actor. But as a person, I have to say,
          not that impressive.' You got a.few
          Oscars. Got any balls?
          Lazarus takes this in.

          SANDUSKY
          Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good
          game, but how's it gonna feel when you're
          sipping Cristalle with your homies.in the

          There is a long beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Shit. I only wish they was filming this
          for my show. I'm in.
          He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause..
          Then...

          We could fooster about for donkey's
          years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and
          nix that mentaller.
          The guys look at each other. What did that mean?

          Byong presses pause on a tape recorder he's holding up to

          RICK (O.S.)
          Chris?

          WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM

          BYON G
          Yes, that was Chris. But you will not
          speak with him again. And do not bother
          trying to trace this call.

          RICK
          What's going on? Who is this?

          BYONG
          We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with
          us now.
          There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he
          nods slowly.

          RICK
          Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your
          little agency. But if you wanna poach my
          client? Lemme tell you something. His
          career's been in a death spiral since
          Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck
          yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn't even
          told you about the whole panda thing! He
          killed a panda! And next time you're at
          a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at
          Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg
          whites with Ron Howard, DON'T LET THAT

          SANDUSKY'
          Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's
          where Speedman was. It looks like they
          move him at night, cause he's not here
          now. Unfortunately we have no idea what
          the layout of that place is.

          sneak him out.

          PORTNOY

          (intermittent pain noises)
          Back in '98, I did a low budget titty
          comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway,
          me and the campers from the uncool camp
          had to break into the rich girls' camp.
          So we did it by building a catapult.
          They shot us over the wall and we
          parachuted down.
          The guys all look at each other... then finally:

          LAZARUS
          That's the stupidest idea I've ever
          heard.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say
          we wait till just before dawn and sneak
          over the fence. Take our chances. You
          guys ok with that?
          The group nods in approval.

          SANDUSKY
          Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and
          Redyk are on first watch.
          (to Lazarus)
          I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll
          switch.

          Yes you are.

          PORTNOY
          Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious.
          Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I
          scream, or however much-I plead, you.must
          not untie me. I will be cunning, I will
          be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil
          works this way. I will say, do, and
          excrete many regrettable things. But.no
          matter what.. .you must leave me alone.
          Beat..

          Man, how can;, you be talking about stars?
          We might not make it outta here tomorrow.

          SANDUSKY
          I don't know. I give us pretty good odds.
          Redykulous looks at'his watch, and lets out a chuckle.

          SANDUSKY
          What's so funny?

          REDYKULOUS
          Nothin'..

          PORTNOY (O.S.)
          .I can't feel my legs!...

          REDYKULOUS
          I'm just thinking about Lill Kantankerous
          Bitch.

          SANDUSKY
          Who?

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          (DRY HEAVES)

          REDYKULOUS
          She's a rapper I'm producing, a twelve
          year old girl. Her first single drops
          tomorrow and I'm not even gonna be there
          to see it.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)
          Ohhhhh GOD! THERE'S BARBED WIRE IN MY

          URINE!

          REDYKULOUS
          I pulled her off the streets six months
          ago.

          SANDUSKY
          You did that?

          REDYKULOUS
          Well, not literally, she was trapped in a
          dead end record deal with Rick Rubin.
          Didn't even have a lawyer. Huh. And here
          I am on the other side of the world.
          About to die for a guy I barely even
          know. Makes Redykulous wonder what's it
          all about.

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to
          think about.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          (TTTTTHHHHWWAAAAAPPP... GURGLE)

          REDYKULOUS
          You single?

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah,... .I guess. I dunno. I got a girl.
           But it's not too serious.

           PORTNOY (O.S.)

          EYES!!!! (VOMITING NOISE)

          SANDUSKY
          I don't think we're in love.

           PORTNOY (O.S.)
          Ohh... . thank God...its Over ...it's
          finally over...

          SANDUSKY:
          It'.s kind of depressing. That feeling of
          not having anyone who really loves you..
          Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him..

          REDYKULOUS
          Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely
          lovable.
          Weird silence.

          SANDUSKY
          What?

          REDYKULOUS
          (removing his arm)
          I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean.
          I have love problems myself!

          PORTNOY.(O.S.)

          OH-H-GOD-! ITS--NOT-OVER!

          SANDUSKY
          .No you don't. What would the great
          Redykulous, know about Girl Problems.
          You're ten girls deep 24 hours a day!

          REDYKULOUS
          .That's the problem.
          Silence.

          SANDUSKY

          Ohh...phew...

          REDYKULOUS
          I know-impossible huh. That's what I
          say sometimes, but its true. Talk abort
          living a loveless life. At least you
          have someone who loves you. I don't even
          have that.

          (THE SOUND OF GIVING BIRTH... then:)

          OH MY GOD. MY SKIN IS A MILLION PIECES OF

          SHATTERED GLASS RUBBING AGAINST AN OPEN

          WOUND!

          REDYKULOUS
          When I think of the nights, alone in my
          penthouse, when I've longed for the
          gentle touch of another dude, to feel his
          skin against mine, or his sweet breath on
          my face.

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          (LOUD SNORING)

          SANDUSKY
          All this from the same guy who
          wrote"Niggaz Gotta Bust a Nut on a Ho".

          PORTNOY (O.S.)

          (LOUD VOMITING)

          REDYKULOUS
          Yeah, well, let me let you in on a big
          secret.

          REDYKULOUS,(cont'd)
          Most of the time, when I'm writing about
          ho's in my songs, 'I really mean Niggaz.
          Creatively, that's the only way I can
          cope.

          SANDUSKY
          So what! You're gay! You're also a great
          artist and-businessman ... why not rap
          about that?

          and fragrances go south? It's all such a
          lie.
          Now he begins to cry .a. little. Sandusky embraces him.

          SANDUSKY.
          Shhh...shhh... .shhh..shhh..shhh... .That's
          it...let it out.

          If you tell anyone I'll have someone
          shoot your. ass.

          SANDUSKY
          I'm not gonna tell anyone, and your not
          gonna shoot me... .th-at's it...l-et -tout.
          Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself.

          REDYKULOUS
          Aww shit... (sniff sniff) I can't. believe
          it's possibly the last day of my life,
          and I'm not even gonna be able to let my
          fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I
          really am.

          SANDUSKY
          (with total sincerity)
          Listen, I know how utterly Redykulous you
          are. Even for just.thisone
          moment. . .and sometimes that enough.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- NIGHT

          Cody, still awkwardly holding the hooks, is yelling at
          Four Leaf.

          CODY
          So all of "Tropic Thunder" is bullshit?

          FOUR LEAF
          No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it
          happened!

          CODY
          Are you even a VET!?

          FOUR LEAF
          YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not
          exactly. I served honorably in what they
          called the "forced service". Sanitation
          Detail at the United States Pentagon.

          CODY
          So you were some two bit criminal who got
          caught and sentenced to clean toilets at
          the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN!

          FOUR LEAF
          God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a
          fuckup, sure, but one day as I was
          cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big-
          wig, I came across a file headed for the
          shredder marked top secret. It was Four
          Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family.
          Nothing. Killed in Action. They were
          gonna bury the whole thing. Total black
          op.

          CODY
          So you decided to take his identity?

          FOUR LEAF
          NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story
          And I gave the American people a hero!
          Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but
          if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody
          woulda ever known who he was! See what
          I'm sayin'?

          CODY
          And you cashed in!

          FOUR LEAF
          I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy
          had a story worth-telling, and nobody
          woulda ever known!
          Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost.

          FOUR LEAF
          I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this
          .whole mess.

          EXT. JUNGLE -- PRE-DAWN

          PORTNOY wakes up, still tied to. the tree, looking like
          shit. But realizes something-that makes him ecstatic:

          PORTNOY
          I'm clean! I'M CLEAN!!!!!
          He struggles to his feet, doing a celebratory dance. He
          immediately gets nauseous again and heaves.

          Pull back to reveal that it is on a piece of paper being

          The text below reads:
          "Flamingg. Dragon has Speedman.lfyou want him, the price is $5O Million."
          There's a phone number below it.

          Rick frowns at the fax. His Hot Assistant comes in.

          He punches up his email. He opens a video attachment. We

          SEE:

          ON RICK'S COMPUTER
          A bad quality video of Speedman sitting in the
          interrogation room.

          BYONG(V.O.)

          to give us the respect we asked for.

          Byong SCREAMS at Speedman, who cowers. Even Rick
          flinches.

           SERIES OF SHOTS as the guerillas ready for an attack...

          EXT. CAMPSITE -- PRE-DAWN

          The guys are suiting up for combat. They apply burnt cork
          to their faces for camouflage.

          SANDUSKY
          This is it. You know what you need to
          do.' Tropic Thunder on three, two, one...

          GUYS

          TROPIC THUNDER!
          They make their way down the hill.

          EXT. FENCE LINE -- PRE-DAWN

           They reach the fence. The coast looks clear and they each
          scamper over...
           Finally, it's PORTNOY'S turn. He's clearly too heavy.
           The fence groans under'his weight. He launches himself --
          and...
          THWANG!!! Slams painfully into the razor wire of the
          fence.
          GUARDS hear the noise. They raise their weapons and
          listen.. They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness...
          The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull PORTNOY
          down, just in time.
          Everyone's inside the perimeter... they quickly make their
          way along the fence line to the entrance of the main
          building, ducking away to avoid a LONE GUARD.

          INT. MAIN BUILDING

          Sandusky makes a series of hand gestures, indicating for
          them to'split up and search for Speedman. A beat. The
          guys all shrug, not understanding. Sandusky repeats the
          hand gestures. Finally he has to speak.
          i 1, 11 11^ï¿½%

          SANDUSKY I 4I4
          (in a loud whisper, also
          signalling what.he's saying)
          FAN OUT! 'GO ROOM BY ROOM ! IF YOU SEE, nci 16,
          SPEEDMAN, give the signal!
          We follow PORTNOY, working his wayldown a hall. He peaks
          around a half opened door...

          A DARKENED ROOM
          .PORTNOY turns on his flashlight to reveal he is in fact
          in... HEROIN HEAVEN! Wall to wall packets, ready,for
          shipment.. PORTNOY is paralyzed. He spots a box with the
          words "For U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting".
          His mouth LITERALLY waters, and'a drop. of .spittle oozes
          from his bottom lip. He doesn't know what to do. He
          gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box.
          marked "pure". It's like holding two grenades...

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He kicks it'open
          to reveal...

          SPEEDMAN
          Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits bolt upright.

          SPEEDMAN
          You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy.

          SANDUSKY
          Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll
          be right back!
          Sandusky runs off to get the guys.

          HALLWAY
          Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of
          his eyes, signalling that he's got "eyes",on Speedman.
          They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops
          them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for "Where is
          Portnoy?", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy.
          No one knbws what he is doing.

          REDYKULOUS

          (FRUSTRATED)
          Where is Portnoy?!

          SANDUSKY
          Shhh!
          A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be
          PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it.
          Redykulous kicks it in.

          HEROIN HEAVEN
          The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags,
          crying.

          REDYKULOUS
          What are you doing, man!

          SANDUSKY
          Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani

          PORTNOY
          I don't care! It doesn't matter what I
          do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one
          will ever respect me...

          REDYKULOUS
          That's not true! Listen, back in the
          day, I used to think I couldn't produce a
          record simply because...

          SANDUSKY
          .he's gay.
          Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say. Beat.

          REDYKULOUS
          Actually I was going to say poor.

          SANDUSKY
          Sorry...

          

          

          

          

          I
          Tropic Thunder 94.

          LAZARUS
          Listen.. .Don't be crazy Portnoy --you're
          not a fuck up. You'make millions of
          people laugh!

          PORTNOY
          You said my farts made them laugh! Leave
          me ALONE!!

          REDYKULOUS.,
           That ain't true Portnoy! Lotta people be
          fartin' and not be gettin' 20 large a pop
          for it!

          OUTSIDE THE DOOR
          .TWO GUARDS hear the noises inside, head. in to check it
          out.

          HEROIN ROOM
          The guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room.
          They can't see the guys through the.shelves packed with
          heroin packets.

          SANDUSKY
          Damnit! We need to go!

          PORTNOY
          No, I can't do it.
          (-l-ooking-in the-pac-ket )
          I need it! I need it!! This'is all I
          deserve.

          REDYKULOUS
          Come on, man...
          And.the guards emerge. around a corner! They jab their
          rifles.at:the guys and SCREAM AT THEM TO PUT THEIR HANDS

          UP!
          The guys all slowly raise their hands...
          Then, in a moment of craziness, PORTNOY CHARGES THE

          GUARDS, PIE-ING THEM IN THE FACE WITH THE HEROIN PACKETS.

          PORTNOY

          LAUGH AT THAT!! LAUGH AT THAT BASTARD!!
          The guards let off a BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as Portnoy
          grinds it into their noses...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 95.

          INT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          They hear the fire. Four Leaf runs to the window. Through
          it he sees the commotion...

          CODY
          What?

          FOUR LEAF
          Something's happening! Get me the hooks!

          HEROIN ROOM
          Portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their
          knees, choking and groggy. After a beat, they collapse.

          PORTNOY
          Let's move! We got about sixteen hours
          before they wake up!
          They run out.

          SPEEDMAN'S CELL
          The guys run in. Redykulous breaks the lock off
          Speedman's ankle with his rifle butt. Sandusky keeps
          watch by the door.,

          REDYKULOUS,
          C'mon! We're busting you out!

          SPEEDMAN
          Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks
          call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.

          REDYKULOUS
          What's wrong with him?

          SANDUSKY
          I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like
          from the movie?

          LAZARUS'
          Shite. I was afraid of this. The same
          thing happened to me when I played Neil
          Armstrong in "Moonshot". They found me in
          an alley in Burbank re-entering the
          Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator
          box.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 96.

          REDYKULOUS
          I heard that movie was good.

          SANDUSKY
          Can you fix him?!

          LAZARUS
          I'll try.
          Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to
          look at him.

          LAZARUS
          .You're Chris Michael Speedman!

          SPEEDMAN
          Ah 1-1-likes pie.

          LAZARUS
          You're the greatest star in the world!
          There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes. It
          passes.

          INT. CODYAND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS

          Four Leaf wedges one of the hooks in the. door jamb, and
          Cody does the same with the other. In one fell swoop,
          :they bust. the door off its hinges.

          E-X-T . DE-T-EN-T-ION-HU-T----DAWN-
          They emerge into the chaos. IT IS DAYLIGHT NOW. A GUARD
          runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook to trip him up. Cody
          knocks him out and grabs his machine gun. He tosses the
          guard's pistol to Four Leaf.

          CODY
          By the way, what's your name anyway?

          FOUR LEAF
          Marvin Kaminsky.

          CODY
          you ever been in this jungle?

          FOUR LEAF
          Nope. First time outta the states
          actually.
          He shoots off a round and they run for cover.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 97.

          INT. SPEEDMAN'S CELL -- CONTINUOUS

          Lazarus is right in Speedman's face. He seems to be
          getting clearer...

          LAZARUS
          The world needs you! It` needs its stars!
          You make people forget how awful and 1ï¿½ I Ii I. 1 ,14M
          depressing their lives are! People love
          your work! And... I love your work, too.
          Speedman is quiet.

          SPEEDMAN I
          Uhhhh-uh-I'm... Spah-speeedman?

          LAZARUS
          Simple Jack was magnificent!

          SANDUSKY
          Is it working?

          LAZARUS
          JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re-
          programming a VCR!!
          (back to Speedman)
          You really committed yourself. And for
          that you DESERVED AN OSCAR!
          Speedman registers this.

          LAZARUS

          (FRUSTRATED)

          C'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO

          YOU ARE!
          Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.

          LAZARUS
          (almost to himself)
          You know who you are... . you do Chris.
          Long beat.

          LAZARUS
          Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do
          this. How can I convince a man he is who
          we know he is, when I can't even convince
          myself of the same thing.
          He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 98.

          Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'.
          so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk
          Lazarus! You're like the greatest actor
          in the motherfuckin' world!

          SANDUSKY
          Guys, let's go, we gotta get outta here!
          I it I. 11h.4%

          LAZARUS
          Am I Redykulous? ... AM I!...Or.am I just
          acting like that's who I am?
          No. The sad fact is... I'm not Sergeant
          Osiris. . .or Father O'Malley ...or' Neil
          .Armstrong. I'm not even .Kirk Lazarus.
          (a beat)
          I have no idea who I am.
          The guys look at him... it's the first time he has let
          his guard down.

          SANDUSKY
          Kirk, this is NOT the time!

          LAZARUS
          And I guess when you-do themath... .and
          boil it all down, I've invented myself so
          many times... .became so many
          people... .that at the end of the.day...I'm

          Look at me! I'm GAY and, I'm proud!
          He winks at Sandusky.

          REDYKULOUS
          That's right! We're.not what we're
          called, or who we pretend to be. We are
          what we are in our hearts. And to me,
          looking into your heart, you're a hero..
          Lazarus looks to Redykulous.

          LAZARUS
          You mean that?

          REDYKULOUS
          .Yup.

          Thera,... from off camera.

          SPEEDMAN
          And I'll second that.
          They all'turn to see...SPEEDMAN. The million-dollar smile
          is back!

          SPEEDMAN
          Now let's get the hell outta here!
          Speedman leads the men to the door. Sandusky tosses
          Speedman'a machine gun.

          SPEEDMAN
          Thanks Kevin.

          SANDUSKY
          My name...you remembered my name. You
          gotta show us the way outta here Chris.

          SPEEDMAN
          Follow me.
          This time they do...

          HALLWAY
          The guys run toward the opening to the courtyard,
          Speedman leading the way...

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS

           They huddle close to the wall, unseen, surveying the
          situation: about 20 GUARDS on full alert... a JEEP about
          30 feet away... beyond that, A HELIPAD with the
          compound's chopper, maybe 200 yards in the distance...

          SPEEDMAN
          That's their supply chopper.

          SANDUSKY
          If we could create a diversion, we could
          get to that jeep and drive it right over
          there...

          

          

          

          

          I
          "Ttopic Thunder 100.

          PORTNOY
          Anybody here know how to fly a
          helicopter? Cause that would come in,
          handy too.

          SPEEDMAN
          You want a diversion? I'll give you a
          diversion. Is this baby loaded?
          He holds up the machine gun...

          SANDUSKY
          Yeah, but...
          And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,..
          the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a CRAZY WAR'

          WHOOP...
          A BUNCH OF GUARDS turns to,see.him... he does a-SUPER
          MACHO TUCK AND ROLL, landing perfectly and EMPTYING HIS

          CARTRIDGE ON. THE GUARDS...

          SANDUSKY
          (to.himself)
          .they're blanks...
          There is a long moment of silence as the guards just
          stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised that. they are
          not dead,. as do the guards themselves. They cock their
          weapons, about to shoot him when.,..
          A HAIL OF-BULLET FIRE-erupts-behind-the-gu-ards... They
          turn...WE REVEAL CODY AND FOUR LEAF BEHIND THEM, THEIR

          GUNS FIRING INTO THE AIR!!

          SANDUSKY
          Let's move!
          The.guys jump into the jeep, Sandusky at the wheel, and
          'gun it..

          SANDUSKY
          Chris, come.on!
          Speedman jumps. into the jeep as it passes by. They are
          speeding toward the helipad.

          SPEEDMAN WATCHES FOUR LEAF AND CODY, WHO CONTINUE

          SHOOTING AT THE GUARDS...

          SPEEDMAN
          Four Leaf! Effects guy! Come on!!

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 101.
          But they can't break away, they-are trying to run toward
          the jeep but are under too much fire...

          SPEEDMAN

          WE GOTTA GET THEM, GO AROUND!!
          Sandusky swings the wheel hard. . .the jeep careens back
          toward the firefight...they come in hard, and SKID TO A

          STOP NEXT TO FOUR LEAF AND CQDY..1.
          Cody jumps in the jeep, but FOUR LEAF DOESN'T...

          SANDUSKY
          Get in the Jeep!

          FOUR LEAF
          You go... I got real bullets! I'll cover
          you.. It's the only way you'll make it!

          CODY
          Marvin, you gotta --

          FOUR LEAF
          Just go!!
          Sandusky looks at Speedman... they both know he's right.
          They go... leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing...
          The jeep speeds up to the helipad... the guys jump out.
          Just as the last guy is out...

          BOOM! A HUGE BLAST FLIPS THE JEEP INTO THE AIR...
          Across the courtyard is TRAN... who just fired an RPG at
          our guys!
          The guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the
          chopper... Sandusky pushes Cody in...

          A

          SANDUSKY
          Start the chopper now Cody!
          Cody nods, getting his bearings... and hitting the
          ignition...the BLADES SLOWLY HUM TO LIFE, BEGINNING TO
          TURN... Portnoy grabs Cody's gun and hangs by the runner,
          shooting towards approaching guards...

          WHAT WE SEE NEXT SHOULD PLAY OUT VERY MUCH THE SAME AS

          THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE:
          Tran is reloading his RPG...

          

          

          

          
          Tropic Thunder 102.
          REDYK and LAZARUS GET. IN, and SPEEDMAN grabs a live
          machine gun off the ground and fires toward TRAN and his
          men.

          LAZARUS

          WE GOTTA GO NOW!! LET'S MOVE!!

          CODY

          BUT FOUR LEAF --

          LAZARUS

          WE'RE. ALL DEAD MEAT IF WE DON'T.LIFT OFF

          NOW!! DO IT CODY!!
          Cody reluctantly pulls up the throttle. The chopper.
          begins to LIFT OFF...

          SPEEDMAN.

          FOUR LEAF IS STILL OUT THERE!

          LAZARUS

          WE GOTTA GO! PORTNOY GET YER ASS IN THIS

          CHOPPER!!

          PORTNOY

          I'M TRYING!!
          Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is genuinely having
          trouble getting in.-the chopper.
          But then Speedman sees something...

          SPEEDMAN
          It's him...

          SPEEDMAN'S POV
          FOUR LEAF... much-like.Speedman playing him in the
          beginning of the. movie... Arms extended, his body riddled
          with bullets...

          LAZARUS

          FOOCK!
          Cody lowers the chopper ... Speedman jumps out...

          SPEEDMAN
          Cover me!
          Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of
          bullets...PORTNOY AND THE GUYS PROVIDE AS MUCH COVER AS

          THEY CAN...

          

          

          

          
          i- Tropic Thunder 103.
          Speedman reaches Four Leaf and collapses beside him,
          cradling his head.
          Trap's men continue to bear down on them...

          FOUR LEAF
          Go on...get outta here. I'm worm food,
          you dig?

          SPEEDMAN

          DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!
          (then totally surprised)
          You have hands?

          ON THE CHOPPER
          The guys are busy shooting off their attackers, but they
          see this moment happening...

          BACK TO SPEEDMAN AND FOUR LEAF
          The life is draining from Four Leaf (Marvin)...

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't Four Leaf, Chris. We're in this
          mess because of me.

          SPEEDMAN
          (can't get over it)
          How did you get hands?

          FOUR LEAF
          I ain't never been worth a nothin'...and
          it's too late to start bein' a somethin'
          now.
          Speedman tries to understand. He is welling up with
          emotion.. .real emotion.

          FOUR LEAF

          (SINCERELY)
          But you... you can tell the story. . .You
          have to tell the real story...
          And Four Leaf... or Marvin... dies.
          Speedman begins to weep. Tears. Yes, he is crying, for
          real...

          EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- DAY

          Peck is tied up, in ragged, prisoner clothes, hanging in
          the cage. He has been there a while.

          PECK
          Ok, look, you wanna go through this
          again, let's do it. I see more for you
          than this. This whole 'big fish in the
          little scary jungle pond' thing. I see
          you as a front man, as a leader, not just
          of this little rebel guerilla warrior
          group. I see it big picture. Is it music,
          is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I
          don't know. But I do know it is not
          happening with you staring at me doing my
          "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" routine
          for you and the peanut gallery for
          another six months. It's old school
          already.
          TRAN and some HENCHMEN watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of
          the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into
          the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a
          soaking Peck.

          PECK
          (not missing a beat)
          And it makes me sad to see you chomping
          on the stogie and you're not even
          fourteen or whatever. I'm thinking "what
          hole does that need to fill, that you
          have to keep dipping me into the water to
          somehow feel better about yourself?" I
          can be a partner to you, not just a
          captive.

          PECK (cont'd)
          But you have to allow me into your inner
          workings, into your headspace to
          facilitate that. And"to do that you gotta
          let me outta the cage,'both figuratively
          and literally. Until you can let me go, I
          you.can't let you go. Do you get that?
          He gets dunked in the water again.

          PECK
          Obviously not. Dare I bring up.a sore
          subject. Can we do a little business on
          the blackberry privileges? Cause you're
          killing me here.

          conversations about how yearbook
          club went and about her friends

          So, what's her name?

          Wicked! How'd you meet her?

                         SCOTT
          I believe I mentioned the bus?
          Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:

          3 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 3

          KNIVES CHAU, 17, cute and innocent with clothes to match,
          sits next to her mother, MOTHER CHAU, 45, demanding.

                         MOTHER CHAU
          You are seventeen year old! Time to
          get interested in boy!

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Mom!
          Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.

                         MOTHER CHAU
          You drop book.
          Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling.

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey...
          Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM
          holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:

          "SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME."
          Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott
          winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          So when do we get to meet her?

                         KIM PINE
          Oh please. Let it be soon.
          DINGY DONG! The doorbell rings. Scott smiles broadly.

          That's for me.

          An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack.

                         SCOTT
          You promise to be good?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Of course I'll be good!

                         SCOTT
          No, really. Please be good.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Am I normally not?
          Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.

                         SCOTT
          Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen
          Stills. He's the talent.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Hey.
          STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Is she gonna geek out on us?

                         SCOTT
          She'll just sit in the corner, man.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          I mean, I want her to geek out on us.

                         SCOTT
          She'll geek. She geeks. She has the
          capacity to geek.

          Knives enters, looking around the rehearsal pad with awe:
          Bare bulb, ratty rug, drums, guitar, bass, LAME BRAND amps.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Wow.

          Knives watches, jaw ajar. The song ends, feedback lingering.

          9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9

          Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He
          turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal.

          "WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"

                         SCOTT
          Before you hear some dirty lies
          from someone else, yes, I'm dating
          a 17 year old.
          Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.

          Is he cute?

          Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.

          So. The whole seventeen year old

          You know me.
          Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting.

                         SCOTT
          Who are you texting?
          RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.

          STACEY (O.S.)
          Seventeen years old? Scandal!
          Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on
          her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'œIf
          you are using your cellphone, you will not be served'.

          "STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN."

          That's not true. Who told you?

          Wallace. Duh.

          That gossipy bitch.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          You know me.
          Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless.

                         SCOTT
          Wallace!
          Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.

          Who is this mysterious child you date?

                         SCOTT
          Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.

                         STACEY
          A seventeen year old Chinese
          schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

                         SCOTT
          It's a Catholic school too.

          Oh my God, you haven't-

                         SCOTT
          No no no. We haven't even held
          hands. I think she hugged me once.

                         STACEY
          Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?

                         SCOTT
          I don't know...it's just nice, you
          know? It's just...simple.

                         STACEY
          It's been over a year since you got
          dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named.
          Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine,
          looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.

          STACEY (CONT'D)
          So, are you legitimately moving on,
          or is this just you being insane?
          Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next
          to a hot redhead in happier times.

                         SCOTT
          Can I get back to you on that?
          A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...

          10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10

          Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
          Uniformed boys and girls pour out.

                         WALLACE
          I do not want to be here. At all.

          This school has boys too.

                         WALLACE
          I hate you. Even I would think twice
          about dating a seventeen year old.

                         SCOTT
          Well, she's only allowed out when
          the sun is up, so I wouldn't call

          Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.

                         SCOTT
          Hey Knives, this is my cool gay
          roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in
          my class is gay?

                         WALLACE
          Yes. Does he wear glasses?

                         SCOTT
          Wallace, you go now! Begone!
          Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.

          You're too good for him. Run.

          11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11

          Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial
          arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION).
          They punch and kick in unison, side by side.

                         SCOTT
          Did you know the original name of Pac-
          man was Puck-man? You would think it's
          because Pac-Man looks like a yellow
          hockey puck, but actually it comes
          from the Japanese phrase paku-paku
          which means to flap ones mouth open
          and closed. They changed it over here
          because Puck-Man is too easy to
          vandalize. You know, scratch out the P
          and turn it into an F or whatever?
          Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Ohmigod, like...wow.

          Yeah. Wow.
          The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8...
          Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.

          Tamara is into this Korean guy,
          Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby
          has a crush on Mina.

          I don't listen to much music. I

          or whatever, but you guys ROCK.

          I knew I personally rocked, but I
          never suspected that we rocked as a

          it might be cool if cool people
          wore our T-shirt.

          Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room.

          Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library.
          He carries a stack of books for Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Libraries remind me of grade school.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          That must seem like a reeeeally
          long time ago.

                         SCOTT
          Uh. Let's talk about something else.
          The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He
          freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM
          skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Do you know that girl?
          The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to
          the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades
          out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Scott?
          Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl.

          A bored Scott stands next to Young Neil in a very crowded

          Well you know Pac-Man was

          Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck

          23 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 23

          Scott lies on the futon, WIDE awake. Wallace storms in.

                         WALLACE
          Guess who's druuunk?

                         SCOTT
          I guess Wallace.

                         WALLACE
          You guess right.
          Wallace flops onto the futon, landing next to Scott.

                         SCOTT
          So, that girl. From my dream.

                         WALLACE
          Girl. Okay...

                         SCOTT
          I saw her at the library...

                         WALLACE
          Library...can I pretend we're
          talking about a guy?

                         SCOTT
          So then I'm at this party, and hey!
          There she is.

                         WALLACE
          There he is.

                         SCOTT
          I think she's...

                         WALLACE
          You think he's...

                         SCOTT
          I think she's the girl of my dreams.

          Mmm. Then you should break up with
          your fake high school girlfriend.

                         SCOTT
          I've never been so sure about
          something.

                         WALLACE
          Then you should break up with your
          fake high school girlfriend.

                         SCOTT
          What's that?

          Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with
          STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone.

                         STACEY
          You're thinking of juggling two chicks!?

                         SCOTT
          Not even!

                         STACEY
          Well, you should break up with your
          fake high school girlfriend.

                         SCOTT
          Wait. Who told you?

                         STACEY
          Duh. Wallace.

                         SCOTT
          He's not even conscious!

                         STACEY
          Whatever. You of all people should know
          how sucky it is to get cheated on.

                         SCOTT
          Don't you have a job to do?

                         STACEY
          You're right. I should send out a
          mass text about this. Bye.
          Scott looks to Wallace, who is out cold, cellphone in hand.

          Attack hug. That's cute.

          Scott and Knives flip through the record bins, out of sync.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Yearbook club is getting SO boring.
          I cannot believe the music they put

          Knives goes to flip over Scott, but he messes up. THE MIRROR

          You don't remember me do you? I met
          you at the party the other day.

                         RAMONA
          Were you the Pac-Man guy?

                         SCOTT
          No. Not even. That was some total
          ass. I was the other guy. You're
          Ramona Flowers right?

                         RAMONA
          That's me.

                         SCOTT
          So, you're like American?

                         RAMONA
          Why, am I coming off as rude?

                         SCOTT
          Not at all. Noooooo...
          Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen.

                         RAMONA
          You know...you need to sign for
          this. Whatever this is?

                         SCOTT
          It's something really cool. You'd
          be impressed.

                         RAMONA
          You still have to sign.

                         SCOTT
          But if I sign for it, you'll leave.

                         RAMONA
          Yeah. That's how it works.

                         SCOTT
          Okay well, can we just maybe just
          hang out sometime? Get to know each
          other? You're the new kid on the
          block, right? I've lived here
          forever. I mean...there are reasons
          for you to hang out with me?

          If I say yes, will you sign for

          Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the
          package straight in the trash.

          Scott finds Ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the

          Why are you just standing there?

          Just needed to escape I guess.

          Is that why you left New York?

          I just haven't been obsessed with a
          girl for a long time. It's weird.

                         RAMONA
          That's probably because you sleep

          of this battle of the bands thing.

                         RAMONA

                         (TOTALLY UNIMPRESSED)

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, we're terrible. Please come.

          Ramona shrugs and ROLLERBLADES through the snow...(somehow)

                         SCOTT
          Wait! Can I get your number?
          SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott.
          She hands him a note. '˜RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'˜

                         SCOTT
          Wow, girl number.
          Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away.

                         RAMONA
          See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.

                         SCOTT
          Oh, hey! It's tonight...At The-

          38 INT. THE ROCKIT - NIGHT 38


          'œTHE ROCKIT, FUN FACT: THIS PLACE IS A TOILET'.
          Ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young
          hipsters, reaching Scott at the bar. He stands with Wallace
          and Stacey. She holds hands with a guy wearing glasses.

                         SCOTT
          You totally came!

                         RAMONA
          Yes. I did totally come.
          Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish.

                         STACEY
          Excuse my brother. He's chronically
          enfeebled. I'm Stacey.

                         RAMONA
          Hey.

                         STACEY
          And this is Wallace, his room-mate.

                         WALLACE
          Hey.

                         STACEY
          And this is my boyfriend Jimmy.

                         WALLACE

          Heyyy.

          And this is Knives, Scott's-
          Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in.

                         SCOTT

          HEYYYYYYYY!

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hey.
          Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives
          looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Do you like?

                         SCOTT
          I...uh...
          LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives
          and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Have. To. Go.
          Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage.

          PROMOTER (O.S)
          This next band are from Brampton
          and they are Crash And The Boys.

          39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39

          Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping
          through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          This is a nightmare. Is this a
          nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up.

                         KIM
          Once we're on stage you'll be fine.

                         STILLS
          We were just on stage. For sound
          check. The sound guy hated us.

                         SCOTT
          It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters.
          People love us. Right?
          Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and
          Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.

          Crash and The Boys tune up. A drunk Wallace turns to Jimmy.

                         WALLACE
          Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?

                         JIMMY
          They...haven't started playing yet.

                         WALLACE
          That was a test, Jimmy. You passed.

                         CRASH
          Good evening. I am Crash, and these
          are the Boys.

                         WALLACE

          IS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO?

                         CRASH
          Yes.
          TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger.

          A41 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS A41

          Sex Bob-omb peer at the band from offstage. Kim glowers.

                         KIM PINE
          They have a girl drummer?

          B41 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS B41


                         CRASH
          This is called "I am so sad. I am
          so very very sad." And it goes a
          little something like this.
          Crash and the Boys play a whole song in .04 seconds.

                         CRASH
          Thank you.
          Wallace yells from the balcony.

                         WALLACE

          IT'S NOT A RACE, GUYS!

                         CRASH
          This song is for the guy who keeps
          yelling from the balcony, and it's
          called "We Hate You, Please Die."

                         WALLACE

          good?
          Kim Pine scowls harder than ever.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          These guys are good.

                         CRASH

          Audience". It'll be our last song
          tonight and your last song EVER...
          Sound explodes from the stage. The audience are stunned.

          43 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 43

          Stills paces backstage as the others watch the band.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          How are we supposed to follow this?
          We're not going to win, we're not
          gonna sign with G-Man and we'll
          never play opening night at the
          Chaos Theatre.

                         (FREAKING OUT)

          GODDAMN IT SCOTT, WILL YOU STOP

          JUST STANDING THERE, YOU'RE

          FREAKING ME OUT!

          44 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 44

          As Crash And The Boys climax, Stacey turns to Ramona.

                         STACEY
          So, how do you know Scott?

                         RAMONA
          He's...um. He's a friend.

                         STACEY
          Hard for me to keep track
          sometimes. He has so many friends.
          Ramona arches an eyebrow. Stacey turns to Knives and Tamara.

                         STACEY
          So Knives, how did you meet Scott?

          Scott looks up into the balcony, sees Stacey talking to
          Knives. He turns around and slaps Stephen Stills in the face.

                         SCOTT
          We gotta play now and loud!

          46 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 46

          Stacey and Ramona listen intently to Knives' story.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Well, I was on the bus with my Mom-
          Knives freezes, staring at the stage.

                         RAMONA
          Is that seriously the end of the story?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          OH MY GOSH, they're on!

          ONSTAGE: A DISHEVELED PROMOTER walks to the mic.

                         PROMOTER
          This next band is from Toronto
          and...yeah. So give it up for
          Sex...Bob-Omb?
          SEX BOB-OMB walk on. Wallace and Knives give the only cheers.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott...you ready?
          Scott nods vigorously.

                         STEPHEN STILLS

          ANGLE on Knives. She faints in the excitement.

          KIM PINE (CONT'D)

          THREE, FOUR!
          Sex Bob-omb rock out, barely into the first verse when a
          chunk of ceiling CRASHES down and a SPINDLY INDIAN HIPSTER
          KID DIVES HEAD FIRST through the hole, finger pointed at
          Scott as he sails towards the stage!

          MATTHEW PATEL lands onstage and glares at Scott through a
          lopsided fringe. He wears an evil grin and a jacket that
          borders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out).

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Mr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew
          Patel. Consider our fight...begun!

                         SCOTT
          What did I do?
          Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.

                         SCOTT
          What do I do?!

                         WALLACE

          FIGHT!
          Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his
          left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right.
          Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Alright. Alright.

                         WALLACE
          Watch out! It's that one guy!

                         SCOTT
          Thank you, Wallace!
          Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and
          sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking
          hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.

                         SCOTT
          Who the hell are you anyway?
          The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters.

          Didn't you get my e-mail explaining
          the situation?

                         SCOTT
          I skimmed it.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          You will pay for your insolence!
          Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and
          counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott
          jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy.

                         WALLACE
          What's up with his outfit?

                         OTHER HECKLER

          Are you a pirate?

          Pirates are in this year!
          Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel
          puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          You really went out with this guy?

                         RAMONA
          Yeah, in the seventh grade.
          The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the
          balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK.

          It was football season and for some
          reason, all the little jocks wanted
          me. Matthew was the only non-white,
          non-jock boy in school, probably in
          the entire state, so we joined
          forces and took 'em all out. We
          were one hell of a team. Nothing
          could beat Matthew's mystical
          powers. Nothing but pre-teen
          capriciousness. We only kissed
          once. After a week and a half, I
          told him to hit the showers.

          Dude, wait...mystical powers?
          Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          You'll pay for this, Flowers!
          Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          If you want to fight me, you're not
          the brightest. You won't know
          what's hit you in the slightest.
          Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with
          fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Me and my fireballs and my Demon
          Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the
          talk because I know I'm slick.
          Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott.
          He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Fireball Girls! Take this sucker
          down.
          The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott
          dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Let us show him what we're all
          about.
          Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs.
          They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings.

                         SCOTT
          That doesn't even rhyme.
          Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and
          throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the
          eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          This is impossible, how can it be?!
          Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time
          to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face.

                         SCOTT
          Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.

          K.O! Scott punches Patel. He explodes into COINS. They
          clatter to the stage floor. Scott lands and picks them up.

          Stacey turns to see Wallace and Jimmy making out.

                         STACEY
          WALLACE?! Not again!
          Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara.

          49 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 49

          Scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them.

                         SCOTT
          Aw man. $2.40? That's not even
          enough for the bus home.

                         RAMONA
          I'll lend you the 30 cents.
          Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage.

                         PROMOTER
          Yeah...so like, Sex Bob-Omb wins.

          50 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 50

          Knives is now wide awake, clapping wildly from the balcony.
          Her eyes scan the venue for Scott...but he is long gone.

                         SCOTT

          A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home.

          What was all that all about?

                         RAMONA

          Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          If we're going to date, you may
          have to defeat my seven evil ex's.

          A bleary Wallace fries bacon. Scott bursts through the front
          door, a spring in his step. The studio audience applauds.

                         WALLACE
          Someone's happy.

                         SCOTT
          Well, someone got to second base
          last night. And someone has a
          second date tonight.

                         WALLACE
          Someone's lucky then.

                         SCOTT
          You know when I say '˜someone', I mean
          me, right? I got to second base last
          night...maybe first and a half.
          Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Oh, hey, I'm inviting Ramona over for
          dinner, so you can't be here tonight.
          I don't want you gaying up the place.

                         WALLACE
          Okay, Scott. But in return I have
          to issue an ultimatum.

                         SCOTT
          One of your famous ultimatums?

                         WALLACE
          It may live in infamy...You have to
          break up with Knives. Today. Okay?
          Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.

                         SCOTT
          But...but...it's HARD.

                         WALLACE
          If you don't do it, I'm going to
          tell Ramona about Knives. I swear
          to God, Scott.

                         SCOTT

          At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and

          DOUBLE STANDARD!

                         WALLACE
          I didn't make up the gay rulebook.
          If you have a problem with it, take
          it up with Liberace's Ghost.

          You're a monster.

                         WALLACE
          Now put the bacon down and go do
          your dirt while I watch the Lucas
          Lee marathon on TBS Superstation.

          LUCAS LEE (ON TV)

          posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist.

          Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll

                         YOUNG NEIL

          Kim mimes shooting herself. Stills unplugs Scott's amp.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Okay! From here on out, no
          GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at
          practice, whether they're old, new
          or new-new. We were lucky to
          survive that last round. This is
          sudden death now. Okay?

                         SCOTT

          Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting BLUE HAIR.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Hey...you're here?

                         RAMONA
          Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool?
          Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development.

                         SCOTT
          You know your hair?

                         RAMONA
          I know of it.

                         SCOTT
          It's all blue.

                         RAMONA
          Yeah. I just dyed it. Are you going
          to introduce me?

                         SCOTT
          Oh yeah, this is Stephen Stills,
          Young Neil, that's... Kim.

                         RAMONA
          Hey everyone.
          Everyone mumbles back. Scott still stares at Ramona's hair.

          Yeah. He's an idiot.
          Scott fake laughs. Starts ushering Ramona out again.

                         SCOTT
          Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Uh, what about rehearsal?

          58 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 58

          Ramona lounges, reading a magazine. A tense Scott hurries
          around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on.

                         WALLACE
          Are you doing okay there?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, good. Good.
          Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act.

                         SCOTT
          She changed her hair.

          I know, but she changed it without
          even making a big deal about it.
          She's spontaneous. Impulsive.
          Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?

                         WALLACE
          I can't believe you were worried
          about me gaying up the place.
          Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket.

          How's dinner coming along?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, good. Good.

          I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm
          heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my
          hetero crush.
          Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.

                         SCOTT
          Don't go.

                         WALLACE
          Will you man the hell up? You could
          get to 2nd and a half base.

          Well, if you strike out in the next

          '15 MINUTES LATER'
          Ramona and Scott eat on the floor, picnic style. Scott has
          cooked garlic bread (and only garlic bread) for dinner.

                         RAMONA
          This is actually really good garlic bread.

          Garlic bread is my favorite food. I
          could honestly eat it for every
          meal. Or just all the time without
          even stopping.

                         RAMONA
          You'd get fat.

                         SCOTT
          No. Why would I get fat?

                         RAMONA
          Bread makes you fat.

          A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar.

                         SCOTT
          So I wrote a song about you.

                         RAMONA
          Oh yeah?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona,
          Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona,
          Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh.

                         RAMONA
          I can't wait to hear it when it's
          finished.

          Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she
          runs her hands through his hair.

          Your hair's pretty shaggy.

          OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!?

          Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I
          got... I got a bad haircut right
          before me and my big ex broke up. But
          it's so long ago, I can barely
          remember it...
          A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.

                         NARRATOR
          Scott is acutely aware that his last
          salon haircut took place exactly 431
          days ago, three hours before his big
          breakup. He blames this largely on the
          haircut and has been cutting his own
          hair ever since.

                         RAMONA
          Sounds like a bad time.

                         SCOTT
          Not really.

                         NARRATOR
          It was.

                         SCOTT
          It was a mutual thing.

                         NARRATOR
          It wasn't.

                         SCOTT
          I mean, she told me it was mutual.

                         NARRATOR
          She dumped him. It was brutal.

                         RAMONA
          What was her name?

                         SCOTT
          She was Nat when I knew her. But
          she stopped liking that name.
          Then...she stopped liking me...

                         RAMONA
          Your hair is cute. I like it long.

                         SCOTT
          But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?!
          Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing
          his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.

          Tell me we didn't come out here
          just so you could cover your hair
          with that hat.

          You seem a little...heightened.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm
          with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not
          that I do drugs, unless you do, in
          which case I do drugs all the time,
          every drug, but...you make me feel...I
          don't know. Things seem a little
          brighter around you or something.
          Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and
          NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.

                         SCOTT
          ...you dated a FAMOUS guy?!

                         RAMONA
          In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually,
          it might have been math. I just
          remember there being lots of drama.

                         LUCAS LEE

          HEY!!!
          Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.

                         RAMONA
          He just followed me around. He was
          a little snot nosed brat.

                         SCOTT
          He had snot? In his nose? But he's
          famous!

                         LUCAS LEE

          HEY!!!

                         RAMONA
          It's not a big deal. I only dated
          him for a week and a half-

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm talking to you Scott Pilgrim!
          Lucas Lee stomps towards Scott, who gasps.

                         SCOTT
          He's famous and he talked to me!

                         SCOTT

          POW! Lucas Lee punches Scott, flooring him. Scott comes back
          up with a pen and paper, wobbly.

                         SCOTT
          Can I get your autograph?
          POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Sup. How's life? He seems nice.
          Lucas Lee THROWS Scott up into a castle turret, crumbling it.
          Scotts CRASHES down through scaffolding onto the set. Lucas
          holds up his hands for a quick continuity photo, then stomps
          over to pick up a dazed Scott from the ground.

                         WALLACE

          Think you stand a chance against an
          A-lister, bro?
          Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down
          ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Some competish you are.
          Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done-
          Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!

          LUCAS LEE (O.S.)
          Looks like you're seeing double.
          Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines.
          POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.

                         LUCAS LEE
          He's good, right? Sometimes I let
          him do wide shots if I feel like
          getting blazed back in my winnie.
          Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS
          STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically
          dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm nothing without my stunt team.
          The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES
          through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.

                         WALLACE
          Ask them how it feels to always get
          his sloppy seconds!

                         SCOTT
          How does it feel to-
          KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a
          barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm gonna get coffee. You homies
          want anything?
          We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear
          the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing.

          Lucas turns, shocked to see Scott, in front of a PAINTED 2-D
          SKYLINE BACKDROP, surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen.

                         SCOTT
          You're needed back on set.
          Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas
          GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP!
          Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline.
          Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Prepare... prepare to feel the wrath
          of the League of Evil Exes!

          Really?

                         LUCAS LEE
          Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer.
          Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets
          him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw.

                         SCOTT
          You are a pretty good actor.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm going for the Oscar this year.

          Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo.

                         SCOTT
          So you can sell them, but can you
          do a thingy on that rail?
          Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          It's called a grind, bro.

                         SCOTT
          So can you do a grind thingy now?

                         LUCAS LEE
          Are you serious? There's like 200
          steps and the rails are garbage.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, if it's too hardcore...

                         LUCAS LEE
          You really think you can goad me
          into doing a trick like that?

          There's girls watching.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Somebody get me my board.
          Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard.

          CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail.
          Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight,
          sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...
          Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.

          Okay, it's 'œlove'. I wasn't trying
          to trick you or anything. Look, if
          she's really the girl of your

          all obstacles that lie in your

          It sounded like you did.

          ENVY (O.S.)
          I gotta go. Nice chatting with you.

                         WAIT-
          CLICK...Scott slumps to the floor. Wallace appears over him.

                         WALLACE
          Okay. Everything does suck.
          Scott grunts. RINGY RING. Wallace grins and grabs the phone.

                         WALLACE
          Or does it?
          Scott sits bolt upright, expectant.

                         WALLACE
          Oh, hey Knives.
          Scott lays back down. FUCK.

                         WALLACE
          What's that? You're outside?
          Scott sits bolt upright again. FUCK! Wallace opens the door a
          crack. Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Is Scott here?

                         WALLACE
          You know what?
          Behind Wallace, we see Scott LEAP through a window head
          first. GLASS SMASHES.

          WALLACE (CONT'D)
          He just left.
          Knives sighs. Scott sprints away in the background.

          Scott walks fast down the street, freaked out and paranoid.
          He sees five '˜X's looming above him on a pedestrian crossing
          and quickly diverts into an...

          Dude.
          WHOOSH - another blast of air whizzes by.

                         SCOTT
          I'm really not in the mood.
          SHWAA - SOMETHING slices the air in front of Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Okay, enough!
          Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A
          DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up
          lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott.

                         MYSTERY ATTACKER
          You punched me in the boob. Prepare
          to die, obviously.

          Well, I'm really, really not up for
          this. Whatever it is.

          Okay little chicken, then I'll see
          you later. But you won't see me.
          Because I'll be deadly serious next

          Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE!

          What can I fucking get you?

                         SCOTT
          Is there anywhere you don't work?

          They're called 'jobs', something a
          fuckball like you wouldn't know
          anything about. And by the way, I
          can't believe you fucking asked
          Ramona out after I specifically
          told you not to fucking do that!
          (Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "FUCK", a
          black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped.)

          RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor.

          Sorry that got a little crazy last
          night.

          Yeah. You kind of disappeared.

          Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know
          it's hard to be around me
          sometimes. I'll understand if you
          don't want to hang anymore.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          And you didn't bang her? Are you gay?

                         SCOTT
          I couldn't stop thinking about my
          stupid ex-girlfriend.
          A bleary Jimmy sits up between them all.

                         JIMMY
          Is that the Uma Thurman movie?

                         WALLACE
          Scott. Just because Envy's back in
          town doesn't make it not over.

                         SCOTT
          Double negative. Tricky.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          It's over. Move on.

                         WALLACE
          Word.

                         JIMMY
          Mm.
          Scott stands (no pants). Music swells.

                         SCOTT
          Right. I'm not gonna let her toy
          with me. From this moment on, I
          will think of Envy Adams no more!

          67 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 67


                         STEPHEN STILLS
          I have distressing news.
          A deadly serious Stephen Stills addresses Kim, Scott and
          Young Neil. Ramona lounges on the couch...

          Is the news that we suck? Because I
          really don't think I can take it.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          No. The Clash At Demonhead are
          doing a secret show tomorrow night.
          And Envy asked us to open for them.

          I hate you.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          A gig is a gig is a gig. Is a gig.
          Maybe you can put your history
          aside until we get through this
          thing. You know, for the band? For
          the band. For the band?

                         SCOTT
          Can't we do our own secret shows?

                         KIM PINE
          All our shows are secret shows.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're doing it. G-man might be
          there! We play the next round of
          the battle Saturday. We need to get
          some buzz going. We need
          groundswell. We need stalkers.
          Stills paces past the window to reveal...KNIVES CHAU OUTSIDE.
          CRASH ZOOM on her tearful face, pressed against the window.
          TOTALLY CRUSHED to see Scott cuddling with Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          What would you do? If your ex was
          in a band and they wanted you to
          open for them?

                         RAMONA
          If my ex was in the band?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah.

                         RAMONA
          It might be a little awkward. But
          maybe it's the grown up thing to do.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, we're all adults right?

          Knives stands on her bed and continues ranting at Tamara.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          He only likes her cause she's old!
          She's probably like 25! She's just
          some fat-ass white girl, you know?

          I think you mentioned she was fa-

          Tamara helps Knives color her hair under the bathtub spigot.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          She's got a head start! I didn't
          even know there WAS good music
          until like two months ago! Okay,
          this really burns.

                         TAMARA
          We should rinse-

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I mean, he knew I was cool but he
          thought I was too young, so he
          tried to find someone cool but old.

                         TAMARA
          She's cool? I thought she was fat-

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Well she THINKS she's cool. This is
          all her fault.

                         TAMARA
          Why?
          Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          It MUST be her fault. Obviously
          it's just a twist of fate or
          whatever, isn't it? Star crossed
          lovers! Born too late!
          Knives looks in the mirror: HER HAIR IS EXACTLY LIKE RAMONA.

          KNIVES CHAU (CONT'D)
          Oh God...I look so...so good.

          How?
          We see a TEXT MESSAGE typing onscreen:

          69 EXT. LEE'S PALACE - NIGHT 69

          A huge line of TOO COOL YOUTHS snakes outside a rock venue. A
          sign reads '˜THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD - Sold out'.
          We hear loud music blasting through the open doors.

          70 INT. LEE'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS 70

          The LOUD MUSIC stops abruptly. Sex Bob-Omb bow onstage.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Thank you. We were Sex Bob-Omb.
          Wallace and Other Scott clap and cheer, drunk. The other
          snobbish kids in the audience shrug and disperse.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We got some merch out the back, so-

          Okay. Bar. Now.

          71 INT. LEE'S PALACE - LATER 71

          A disillusioned Sex Bob-Omb hang with Ramona at the bar.

          Ramona does her eyeliner. She looks in the mirror to see two
          images of herself staring back. Or is it...
          "KNIVES CHAU, 17, SINGLE WHITE ASIAN" with identical hair,
          clothes and makeup, standing next to Ramona, looking hot.

                         RAMONA

          Ramona exits, confused. Knives follows.

          Ramona and Knives exit the bathroom together. Scott breaks
          into a cold sweat. Knives shoots Scott a sultry look.

          Knives heads into Young Neil's arms at the other end of the
          bar. Scott struggles with something resembling jealousy.

          THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD materialize, ENVY in a long black
          coat. Knives screams her teen brains out.
          The BASS PLAYER steps into the light, no longer shrouded in
          dry ice, he cuts a handsome, striking ROCK GOD figure.

          I was just there. We played the

          Scott jumps to his feet, FACING OFF against Todd Ingram.

          Knives!?
          Young Neil rushes to Knives' aid. Scott boils. Todd smirks.

                         TODD INGRAM
          That's right. I'm not afraid to hit
          a girl. I'm a rock star.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          You punched the highlights out of
          her hair!
          ANGLE on Knives. Her hair is black and plain as before.

          He punched the highlights. Out. Of.
          Her. Hair.

          Young Neil escorts Knives out. Todd sits back down like
          nothing happened. Scott's face is a bright shade of rage.

                         JULIE
          So, are you guys doing anything fun
          while you're in town?

          Scott LEAPS across the table and SWINGS a punch at Todd.
          Todd THRUSTS a hand out and telekinetically FREEZES SCOTT IN
          THE AIR. Scott hovers, grasping his neck, choking. Todd's
          hair magically forms into a FAUXHAWK.

          Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb peer through the newly made hole in
          the wall, to see Scott sprawled on some trash bags. He tries
          to keep cool, despite being in a lot of pain.

                         SCOTT
          No kidding...anyone can be...vegan.

          Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

          Ovo what?

                         TODD INGRAM
          I partake not in the meat nor
          breastmilk or ovum of any creature
          that has a face.

                         ENVY
          Short answer: Being vegan just
          makes you better than most people.

                         TODD INGRAM
          Bingo.
          Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into
          the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Hey man, question. I always
          wondered, how does not eating dairy
          products give you psychic powers?

                         TODD INGRAM
          You know how you only use ten
          percent of your brain? Well, it's
          because the other 90% is filled up
          with curds and whey.

          Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

          Go ahead and get snippy baby, if
          you knew the science, maybe I'd
          listen to a word you're saying.
          Scott returns to earth with a THUMP. He moans in pain. While
          the others bicker, Ramona helps Scott to his feet.

          backstory that can help me out in a
          critical moment of not dying? Yes.
          A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          I was only dating Lucas until the
          minute Todd walked by. I guess
          that's not very nice, but I used to
          be kind of...like that.
          Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making
          out with Young Todd.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          We hated everyone. We wrecked
          stuff. Nobody cared.
          Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff. Nobody cares.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          He punched a hole in the moon for
          me. It was pretty crazy.
          Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          A week and a half later, he told me
          his Dad was sending him to the
          Vegan Academy, so I dumped him.
          Does that help you at all?
          The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect.

                         SCOTT
          Have you dumped everyone you've
          ever been with? You've never been
          the dumpee?
          Ramona shrugs.

                         RAMONA
          Look, I've dabbled with being a
          bitch. It's part of the reason I
          moved here. I was really hoping to
          put it all behind me.

          Scott HEADBUTTS TODD, exploding him! POOM! Scott dusts
          himself off as COINS rain down. Envy stares, jaw ajar.

                         SCOTT
          Uh, sorry I guess.

                         ENVY
          Sorry? You just headbutted my
          boyfriend so hard he burst.

                         SCOTT
          You kicked my heart in the ass. So
          I guess we're even. Natalie.

                         ENVY
          No one calls me that anymore.

                         SCOTT
          Maybe they should. Now let's get
          out of here.
          A battle worn Scott limps through the hole in the wall.
          Ramona follows, shooting Envy a look on the way out.

                         RAMONA
          Crummy way to end things, I know.
          Envy blinks, in shock. Julie pops into shot.

          80 INT. PIZZA PIZZA - NIGHT 80

          Sex Bob-Omb, Wallace and Other Scott munch pizza slices.
          Ramona and Scott, on the fringes. It's an odd mood.

                         WALLACE
          Envy Adams. I hate that bitch so
          much I kind of love her.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Yeah. That Todd guy was cool too.
          And hot. I liked him.
          Scott sighs and holds a cold Coke Zero on his forehead.

                         RAMONA
          Are you okay?

                         SCOTT
          Uh huh.

                         RAMONA
          You sure about that?

                         SCOTT
          Do I look like I'm not okay?
          Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're still going to the after show
          right?

                         KIM PINE
          I'm not sure it's gonna be much of
          a party, I think a third of the
          band just went 'œpoom'.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Cool bands never go to their own
          after parties. It's just the
          desperate people trying to rub
          elbows with label guys.

                         KIM PINE
          Then why would we...oh.

          I'll do whatever you want to do.

                         SCOTT
          So let's go.

          Oh.

                         WALLACE
          I mean, not with fists.

          The whole gang trudge to the after party. Scott limps a bit,
          lagging behind. Ramona falls back with him.

                         RAMONA
          We really don't have to go to this
          thing. It'll probably be a bad
          scene all around and we've already
          had a full night.

          My baggage doesn't try and kill me

          I believe...I broke up with her.

                         RAMONA
          And was she cool with that?

                         SCOTT
          Knives is with Young Neil now,
          she's totally cool with it.
          They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no
          interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly.

                         RAMONA
          You sure about that?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. She's very mature for her
          age. It was a very healthy break
          up. We're all peaches and gravy.
          We hear an offscreen distant '˜nooooo' from Knives.

                         RAMONA
          And what about you and Kim?
          They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.

                         SCOTT
          Me and Kim? I can barely remember.
          Why, is it important?

                         SCOTT
          It was just...yeah. I don't know.
          It was high school. She had
          freckles. It was cool, I guess.

          That's really the whole story?

                         SCOTT
          OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get
          with her! I fought a crazy eighty
          foot tall purple suited dude! And I
          had to fight 96 guys to get to him,
          too! He was flying and shooting
          lightning bolts from his eyes! He
          was totally awesome and I kicked
          him so far he saw the curvature of
          the earth! Does that make you feel
          any better?

          Welcome to the club.
          In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection:
          fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.

                         SCOTT
          Sorry. I'm not usually like this.

          I'm like anymore.

          Roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified Scott.

                         ROXY
          Meaning your precious Scott must
          defeat me with his own fists. Or
          possibly feet.

          I'm not sure I can hit a girl.
          They're soft.

                         RAMONA
          You don't have a choice.
          Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES
          with deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious
          volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces.

                         ROXY
          Fight your own battles, lazy ass!
          PAF! Roxy disappears then REAPPEARS between Scott and Ramona,
          kicking them apart with the splits. Roxy then KICKS Scott
          into the ceiling. He lands HARD on the floor.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          Every Pilgrim reaches the end of his
          journey. Some sooner than others.
          Roxy lifts her leg over her head, preparing to drop her boot
          of DEATH on Scott's head. She grins at Ramona.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          Your B.F's about to get F'd in the B!

                         RAMONA
          Her weak point's the back of her knees!

                         SCOTT
          What? How does that work?

                         RAMONA
          Whenever we were making out, I-

                         SCOTT
          Okay.
          As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and
          lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.

          GRAPHIC: 'œTICKLE TICKLE!'

                         ROXY
          Oh...
          Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic
          meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          You'll...never...be able to do this
          to herrrrrrrrrrr!
          Roxy screams in ecstasy before EXPLODING into COINS. A spent
          Scott is left standing in the middle of the room.

           Scott flushes red and retreats back to the bar. Ramona
           follows tentatively. The gossip echoes around them.

                          RAMONA
           Sooooo...

                          SCOTT
          Two gin and tonics please.

                         RAMONA
          I thought you didn't drink.

                         SCOTT
          Only on special occasions. Why? Did
          you want one?
          Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.

                         RAMONA
          I guess we really don't know that
          much about each other do we?
          Scott seems immediately drunk.

                         SCOTT
          Maybe you could just give me a list
          of all your exes so at least I know
          who's going to beat my ass into the
          ground next.

                         RAMONA
          Oh, like a handy little laminate or
          something? Let me see if I can find one.
          (looks through bag)
          Maybe we could exchange our information.
          Scott has already downed his second drink.

                         SCOTT
          Just out of sheer curiosity and
          concern for my mortal well-being,
          is there anyone at this party you
          haven't slept with?

          EVERY GUY AND GIRL AT THE PARTY

          HEY!
          Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair.

                         RAMONA
          I really think we should split.

                         SCOTT
          As in '˜get out of here'? Or as in
          '˜split split'?

          How could I not? I feel like we just
          washed our sexy laundry in public.

                         RAMONA
          Dirty laundry. You're drunk.

                         SCOTT
          (holds up 2 fingers)
          I've had like one drink.

                         RAMONA
          Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't
          enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm
          sick of it. I thought you might be
          more understanding.

                         SCOTT

                         I JUST-

                         RAMONA
          You're just another evil ex-
          boyfriend waiting to happen.
          Ramona walks off and loudly announces.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          And yes, there is someone at this
          party I haven't slept with. You.
          Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the
          room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party.
          But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          P.S. Here's your stupid list.
          Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-

          'œPATEL, LEE, INGRAM, RICHTER, KATAYANAGI TWINS, GIDEON...'

                         SCOTT

          rehearsal room feels empty without Knives or Ramona.

                         KIM PINE
          Ramona dated twins?

          girls cockblocking the rock.

          Young Neil can fill in for you.

          It's not an issue. You know bands,
          I know battles. We got it covered.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, we'd understand if you didn't
          want to take part.

          Not only do I want to take part. I

          MONOLITHIC WALL OF ELK AMPLIFIERS. On the other, SEX BOB-OMB,
          with their dinky LAME BRAND amps behind them.

          Okay. My bad.

          Your bad is saying my bad.
          Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind
          their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned
          between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS.

          Come on man! I put aside my
          problems for the music. If I can do

          nondescript MYSTERY GEEK in blazer and black rimmed glasses.
          They are chatting. She looks happy. Scott turns bleak again.

          Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage.

          Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting
          an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that
          it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the
          ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.

          Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT, their sound blowing a mass of snow
          towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome.
          Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up
          to the Japanese character for 'œ11'. Their waveforms transform
          the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON!
          Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from
          the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS
          SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers.
          Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Let's break up now and get it over
          with. We screwed the pooch in front
          of Gideon Graves. We're done.

                         SCOTT
          Gideon...is here? Where?
          Stills points to the 'œMystery Geek', who smirks and whispers
          in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.

                         SCOTT
          That's Gideon?
          Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He
          struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as
          Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.

                         SCOTT
          Alright. Let's do this!
          Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in
          heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!
          Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms
          transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI!
          The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their
          Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect
          beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music.
          The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in
          time to the music!
          Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce
          PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon. Sex

                         KIM PINE
          That...was epic.
          The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears,
          hovering next to Scott.
          Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are
          gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott. What are you doing?

                         SCOTT
          Getting a life.
          Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still-
          applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES
          standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I just came to see the show. I'm
          not even stalking you.
          Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.

                         SCOTT
          You seem... different.
          Knives shrugs, different.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I feel like I know stuff now.
          Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of
          GREEN HAIR exiting the building.

                         SCOTT
          Ramona...
          Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.

          Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue.

          Great. Listen, I know you just play
          mysterious and aloof to avoid
          getting hurt. I know you have
          reasons for not wanting to talk

          A sleek black '˜61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.

                         RAMONA
          It's Gideon. I just...I can't help

          VOICE (O.S.)
          That's the bad news.
          GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in
          tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          The good news, Scottie, is I'm
          officially loving the Sex Bombs.

          Scott glowers. Ramona looks at the floor. Stills is ga-ga.

          I'm signing you right now for a three

          Gideon produces a CONTRACT and clicks a pen.

          You think we're gonna sell our
          souls to you? Well then guess-
          We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is
          furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs
          it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band
          with this douche-in-charge.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Scottie, buddy, can I just say,
          keep your emotions in check. Don't
          let what's past screw up your
          future.
          Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the
          mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          The people need to hear us, Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Then you're going to need to find
          someone else to play bass.
          A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.

                         GIDEON
          Looks like we're all set.
          Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all
          round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.

                         GIDEON
          Oh and Scott, we should really be
          thanking each other. I mean, if it
          wasn't for me, you would have never
          been with Ramona, but if it wasn't
          for you, she wouldn't be back with
          me. So I guess it all shakes out.
          Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.

                         GIDEON
          And hey, the whole League of Evil
          Exes thing? I was in a dark place
          when I put that together. Forgiven?
          Gideon disappears into the Lincoln and drives off and Sex

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S)
          Sure you did. Well as you know, I'm
          opening a new Chaos Theatre in
          Toronto and The Sex Bobs are
          playing our grand opening tonight,
          and it would feel really weird for
          all of us if you weren't there.
          They just did a sound check and the
          acoustics in here are amazing.

                         SCOTT

                         (GRIM)
          Yeah. Maybe I'll see you there.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          I hope so, amigo. I don't want
          anymore bad blood between ex's.
          What do you say?

                         SCOTT
          Mm.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Okay laters.
          Click.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          What a perfect asshole.
          Scott turns, alarmed. REVEAL Wallace on the other cordless.

                         WALLACE
          Forget what I said earlier. Finish him.

          92 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - NIGHT 92

          Snow blows around a steely eyed Scott as he stomps towards a
          group of desolate WAREHOUSES near the water. A lone HIPSTER
          KID smokes a cigarette, leaning against a warehouse wall.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Password?
          Scott shrugs.

                         SCOTT
          Whatever.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          The Hipster Kid waves Scott in.

          93 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 93

          The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a
          GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Second password?
          Scott gives the slightest shrug.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good.

          94 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 94

          Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND
          LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE.
          All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate
          snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck
          Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them.

                         COMEAU
          Yeah, their first album is so much
          better than their first album.
          Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are
          playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on
          bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott!
          Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates.

          STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D)
          Let it go. Don't give him the
          satisfaction.

                         SCOTT
          What if I want the satisfaction?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, then you're doomed.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim!
          Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a
          BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos
          Theatre. Somebody get this man a
          drink! Coke Zero right?
          A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero.
          Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!

                         SCOTT
          I'm not here to drink.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I got no beef with you.

          thing with the Guild?

                         SCOTT
          You mean 'œThe League'?

                         GIDEON
          Guild, League, whatever. It's
          ancient history.
          Gideon puts his arm around Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          I'll show you how ancient of
          history it is.
          Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          No use crying over spilt Coke,
          buddy. The lady made her choice and
          we're all gonna have to move on.

                         SCOTT
          Well I ain't moving...buddy.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          You want to fight me for her?

                         SCOTT
          Was that not clear?
          (to Sex Bob-Omb)
          Was that not clear?
          Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Now why on earth do you want to do that?

                         SCOTT
          Because, I'm in love with her.
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He
          reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.

          NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Scott earned the power of love...
          Ramona looks away from Scott. Gideon smiles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I think this deserves a song.

          We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to
          make money, and sell out and stuff.
          Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT.

          A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT.
          Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes
          at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS.
          Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Ramona. My cane.
          Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle.
          He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there.
          Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends
          like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands.
          Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.

                         SCOTT
          Your club sucks, by the way.
          Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.

                         GIDEON
          If my cathedral of cutting edge
          taste holds no interest for your
          tragically Canadian sensibilities,
          then I shall grant you a swift exit
          from the premises. And fast
          entrance into HELLLLLLL.
          Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...

          KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

          SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!!
          KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of
          Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling
          down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          That is priceless.
          Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly
          recovers and POINTS a furious finger.

          Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights
          defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.

          You can't say I don't know how to
          put on a show.
          GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's
          tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.

                         RAMONA

          Alright... the truth is, it was me
          who was obsessed. I was crazy about

          You can't say I didn't try. I
          really fought for you back there.

                         RAMONA
          Uh-huh.
          The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away.

                         RAMONA
          But someone was fighting pretty
          hard for you back there.
          Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,

                         SCOTT
          Knives?

                         RAMONA
          I wish I was ever as fanatically
          devoted to anything as that girl is
          to you.
          Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.

                         SCOTT
          I feel like I learned something. Which
          would be great if I wasn't dead.
          Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.

                         SCOTT
          So...so alone.
          DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Ahhhhhh...
          We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST
          FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We
          hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart.

                         SCOTT

          ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...

          96 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 96

          We FAST FORWARD all the way to Wallace's apartment, as Scott
          enters. He flicks the light on.

          ...AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I

          HAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN!

          SOME GUY (O.S.)
          Again?

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Turn off the light!
          Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK...

                         SCOTT
          Wallace, when my journey began, I
          was living in an ordinary world.
          Ramona skated through my dreams and
          it was like a call to adventure, a
          call I considered refusing. But my
          Mentor, that's you, told me if I
          want something bad enough I have to
          fight for it. So I did. There were
          tests, allies, enemies. I
          approached a deep cave and went
          through a crazy ordeal, during
          which I totally seized the sword.
          Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected!
          Now I realize what I should have
          been fighting for all along. But
          before I do that, I need to ask one
          final favor of you.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Sure thing, guy.

                         SCOTT
          Could you put a robe on and hand me
          the phone?
          Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Scott. I was just about to-

                         SCOTT
          Hey, pal. I feel terrible about
          everything. I don't want any hard
          feelings, so I figure why not be
          the bigger man and give you a call.

          Scott hangs up and heads for the door, hardcore.

                         WALLACE

          GO KICK THAT GUY'S ASS!

          97 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - DAY 97

          Scott Pilgrim RUNS towards the desolate WAREHOUSES. The same
          HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette against the wall.

                         SCOTT
          Your hair looks stupid.
          The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS.

          98 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 98

          Scott approaches the two Hipster Kids guarding the ELEVATOR.

          '˜Sup?

          DING! Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S

                         COMEAU
          Yeah, their first album is so-
          Scott KNOCKS DOWN Comeau and looks to Sex Bob-Omb.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott! Let it go.

                         SCOTT
          Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
          Stephen, the new line-up rocks. You
          guys sound better without me. Young
          Neil? You have learned well. From
          this point forward, you shall be
          known as 'œNeil'. And Kim?
          Kim looks at Scott, deadpan as ever.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Sorry about...everything.
          Kim shrugs.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim!
          Scott turns to GIDEON on his throne, Ramona at his side.

          GIDEON GRAVES (CONT'D)
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos-

                         SCOTT
          Save it. You're pretentious, the club
          sucks, I have beef, let's do it.
          Scott goes straight into fight mode.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          You want to fight me for her?
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A strange new power overcomes
          Scott, different than before.

                         SCOTT
          No...I want to fight you for me.
          Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest.

          NARRATOR (V.O.)

          Kim drives a hardcore beat. Sex Bob-Omb ROCK THE FUCK OUT.
          HIPSTERS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM to the BEAT. Scott swings his
          FLAMING RED SWORD, exploding each attacker into COINS.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Ramona. My cane.
          Ramona hands Gideon his cane. He unsheathes his SWORD. Scott
          and Gideon RUN towards each other, LEAPING in the air. They
          pass in the air and Scott SLASHES. They land on opposite
          sides of the platform, backs to each other.

                         SCOTT
          How's it going back there?

          Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head
          SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK.
          They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Steal my boyfriend, taste my steel.
          Scott jumps between them, hands held out.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)

          ENOUGH!
          Knives tries to go around him. Scott GRABS her wrists. She
          kicks him in the face.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and
          I will have my revenge!

                         SCOTT
          No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated
          on you.
          Knives steps back, stunned.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          You cheated on me Scott?

                         SCOTT
          I cheated on both of you. And I'm
          sorry. I was a different guy back
          then.
          Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona.

                         SCOTT (CONT'D)
          And...you're not a fat ass. She didn't
          mean that. So, are we all good?
          Ramona rubs the back of her head. The CHIP no longer blinks.

                         RAMONA
          Never felt better.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Are we all done with the hugging
          and learning? I thought we had a
          fight going here.
          All turn to see GIDEON; bloodied, but still grinning, a
          lopsided slash across his face accentuating his smirk.

          Wrong move, baby.
          Scott ATTACKS with his sword. Gideon BLOCKS, disarms Scott
          with one move, spins and BUTTS Scott in the face with the
          hilt of the sword. Scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid.
          Knives throws her knives. Gideon's lightning fast sword
          deflects them, SHING SHING!
          Gideon wheels towards Ramona, expecting her to move. She
          looks doubtful, takes a hesitant step towards him. He grins.

          GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Yeah. You're still my girl.
          Ramona steps up to Gideon and whispers in his ear.

                         RAMONA
          Let's both be girls.
          Ramona knees Gideon in the balls.
          Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her
          scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him.
          Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of

          FREEZE FRAMES.
          Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a
          PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor.
          Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip. He shakes off the
          assault and grins.

                         GIDEON
          You made me swallow me gum. That's
          going to be in my digestive tract
          for seven years!
          Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER
          UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an
          'œX' with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD.
          He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely
          dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time
          to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'œX'.
          Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down.
          Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and
          scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her.
          SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in
          the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks
          with his sword and is sent UP into the air. Gideon jumps
          after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.

          Scott lands hard. Gideon lands in front of him and raises his
          sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE,
          cancelling out Gideon's digital sword.
          Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully
          tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom.
          Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon.
          COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott
          punches, sending Gideon back and forth like a pinball: KICK
          PUNCH KICK PUNCH KICK! Gideon's face smashes with each
          impact.
          Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass.
          Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor,
          she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a
          wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning.
          Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his
          glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

          GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Who do you think you are Pilgrim?
          You think you're better than me?

                         SCOTT
          You're right. I'm not cool enough
          for Ramona. And you got another
          thing right. You are blowing up.
          Right now.
          Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face.
          Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of
          the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty-

          POOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
          SHIMMERING COINS rain down. Scott and Knives kiss.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Whoa...

                         KIM PINE
          There goes our deal.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're still getting paid, right?
          Kim points to the falling coins.

                         KIM PINE
          There goes our deal.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Oh...
          Stills jumps off stage and picks up coins.
          The coin rain continues, silhouetting Scott and Knives in
          their kung fu poses. They share a smile.

          RAMONA (O.S.)
          You two make a good combo.
          Ramona, awake now, makes her way towards them.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah?

                         RAMONA
          Yeah.

          The trio walk down the pyramid steps. Scott picks up Gideon's
          fallen glasses.
          The glasses GLIMMER. GIDEON'S VOICE echoes.

          GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
          You can defeat me...but can you
          defeat...yourself?
          Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL
          MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and
          Scott whips around to face...

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Negascott!
          NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed
          hair. Dark clothes. Evil face.
          Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.

                         SCOTT
          No. This is something I have to
          face on my own.
          The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward
          to confront his dark side.
          Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...

          100-103 OMITTED 100-103

          104 EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - EVENING 104

          Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre.
          They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott.
          Then...
          Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake
          hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          What happened?

                         SCOTT
          Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit.
          He's a super-nice guy. We actually
          have a lot in common.
          Scott runs his fingers through his hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Your hair.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          It's getting really shaggy.
          Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I like it.
          Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking
          his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.

                         SCOTT
          You do?
          Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
          her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.
          Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... Where are you going?
          Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.

                         RAMONA
          I dunno. I should probably
          disappear.

                         SCOTT
          After all that?

                         RAMONA
          It's hard, you know? I came here to
          get away, but the past keeps
          catching up. I'm tired of people
          getting hurt because of me.
          Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.

                         SCOTT
          I think I understand.
          Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.

                         RAMONA
          I should tahnk you, though.

                         SCOTT
          For what?

                         RAMONA
          For being the nicest guy I ever
          dated.

                         SCOTT
          That's kind of sad.

                         RAMONA

                         (ALMOST LAUGHING)
          It is kind of sad.
          She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.

                         RAMONA
          Well... Bye and stuff.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. And stuff.
          She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-

          KNIVES (O.S.)
          Go get her.
          Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Wha?

                         KNIVES
          You earned it. You've been fighting
          for her all along.

                         SCOTT
          But what about you?

                         KNIVES
          (totally sweet and sad)
          I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you
          anyway.
          She grins and kisses his cheek.

                         KNIVES
          There's someone out there for me.
          We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her.
          Guitar still in hand.
          We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame.
          Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-

                         KNIVES
          Go talk to her. Before she's gone.
          Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey... mind if I tag along?

          Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.

                         RAMONA
          You want to come with me?

                         SCOTT

                         (HOPEFUL)
          I thought maybe we could... try
          again?
          Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
          earlier. Scott takes it.
          We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
          middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
          Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
          over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
          to spring.
          Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
          '˜Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
          cell phone airwaves.

          JULIE (V.O.)
          Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
          Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
          with Gideon Graves at the grand
          opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
          was apparently awesome.

          STACEY (V.O.)
          Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
          mean bananas. My little brother
          kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
          It was unbelievable. Someone
          seriously should have been filming
          it.
          Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
          heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars
