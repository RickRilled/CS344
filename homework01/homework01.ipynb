    "1.1  It seems to me that AI would have to use some form of API to run on itself to determine what it is doing and display that output. This increases the focus on the \"intelligence\" part of the AI, which by its own nature, it does not contain like a human does. If we wanted AI to think about itself, we would have to be prepared for the existential repercussions of AI that can have honest \"feelings\". To me, I'd prefer for it to be a long series of complicated instructions that only mimic human ability. \n",
    "I would assume that an Ai with these capabilities could be effectively very beneficial for the bottom line. A robot with the ability to know how import its job is might, figuratively, try harder. That statement, however, is not consistent with what I as a christian believe can be introspective. Thinking about yourself is special to creatures made in the image of God. That alone is humans, given dominion over creation, which includes computer technology. "
