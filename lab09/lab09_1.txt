a. It did decently well, at a value of 0.45, but that was very consistant, meaning it does not
do a great job of catchting the subtle changes and coming up with a predictive out put.

b.  L2 does not notice the difference between 0.9 and 0.9999, which is a huge difference in confidence. LogLoss
does a better job of taking confidence into account. It also penalizes the errors in confidence.

c. It comes to the conclusion that pretty much every house is high income, because it outputs above 0.5
This is only marginally better than the linear model, which guessed they were all lower.

d.  I used a learning rate of 0.0000025, steps 25000, and a batch size of 700. The best value I got was 0.79 for the AUC and 0.72
for accuracy
