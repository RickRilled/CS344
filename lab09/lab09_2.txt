a. We are trying to make the model more efficient, so we use regularization, with respect to sparsity. This
moves weights in the model to zero, so it runs faster.

b. L1 determines when a feature is not needed and moves the weight to zero. This helps to underfit
the model and increase sparsity.

c.  period 06 : 0.25
    regularization_strength=0.7
