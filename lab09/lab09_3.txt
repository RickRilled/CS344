Exercise 1

a. 1000 training examples and 500 validation examples

b. It is similar in structure to the one we did in class.

c. There is a sharp contrast in what the model sees when the background cahnges. For example, the outline of the cat is strong,
since it is being compared to the background.

Exercise 2

a.  Adjusting the data to create, essentially, new training data from the existing set. This helps
prevent overfitting and allows the model to generalize.

b.

history = model.fit_generator(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=100,
      epochs=30,
      validation_data=validation_generator,
      validation_steps=50,
      verbose=2)

      Accuracy: 74%
