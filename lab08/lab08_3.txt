a. Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib, like keras is built on top of tensor flow. It provides additional types of plots
for more detailed data description.

b. There are 397 rows, which seems like the right amount to be training on to get a strong model, without over fitting.

c. Normalizing the data means putting all the data on the same scale. This way we can compare data points accurately, without
misrepresenting some data as more or less important.

d. Yes, it it uses input data to make a prediction on multiple variables.

e. Yes, a large network means more complexity. This is good for a complex problem with many dimensions, but not for small datasets.
Complexity with small data spells over fitting. Keeping the model small, in conjunction with the data, is best for that application.
