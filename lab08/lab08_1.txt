a.  The pearson correlation coefficient measures what affect different features have on one another. A negative value means negative
correlation, and a positive value means positive correlation. The features selected, "longitude" and "latitude", provide a -0.9 coefficient,
meaning almost perfect negative correlation. This makes sense, as the two values are basically inverts of each other.

Task 1-

minimal_features = [
  "median_income",
  "latitude",
]

Task 2-

for r in LATITUDE_RANGES:
    selected_examples["latitude_%d_to_%d" % r] = source_df["latitude"].apply(
      lambda l: 1.0 if l >= r[0] and l < r[1] else 0.0)


_ = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.05,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    training_examples=selected_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=selected_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

    RMSE: 83.96
