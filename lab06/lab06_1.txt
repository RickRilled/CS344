Framing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We want the machine learned model to:
    Determine if a Gmail email is important.

Our ideal outcome is:
    Each email we send the model will be correctly labeled as "important" or "not important"

Our success metrics are:
    All important emails are labeled correctly.

Our key results (KR) for the success metrics are:
    The number of emails that should be labeled as important .

The output from our ML model will be:
    A set of important emails.

The output is defined as:
    every email included in the output set should be an important email

The output from the ML model will be made:
    Incrementally as emails are added to the set, until the test data is fully tested. It will be presented to the user by marking the email with a distinguishing image and placing it in the users inbox.

The outcome will be used for:
    New emails entering the users inbox.

If we didn't use ML, we would:
    Use a set of words or a corpus that we might nd in an important/non important email, create a hash table of probabilities, then scan the new email through these probabilities and determine, using Bayesian metrics, if it is important.

Formulating
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary Classification, which predicts what 2 labels to assign some object.

Using emails are input, we must label them as important and not important, depending on the data in the email.

Input 1: Subject | input 2: contents | input 3: sender | output: label
