Deep neural networks have proven, in my opinion, to be more than a bust as we have seen in the past. Whether it was writing music with Google’s Bach Doodle from March, or automatic driving cars from Tesla and Audi that have proven to be better than humans at avoiding collisions, save a few human caused examples. I think it is no question they have proven to integrate into our society and make meaningful change. The bigger question is what that means for humans.

When we create these machines, we add a value to them. Nothing we code or create is truly neutral. Because of this reformed view, the networks we design change the ecology of the system they are implemented in. Though I don’t think the advancements are a bubble, our reactions to them are more important. They will affect us in the future in the way we interact with the world. They will change who we meet socially (online or otherwise), what we see and consume in media, and how we deal with conflict in our borders. We are already seeing this change, and I cannot help but think that this will continue to become apart of our society for years to come.
