2.1
a)Each algorithm solves the problem with relative ease. It seems to do so at the same values with the same effectivness.
b)Simulated annealing(SA), with hill climbing at 3.743 and SA at 0.0049
c)Yes, a higher x value increases the time each algorithm takes. Also, at high values like 500, hill climbing is the faster option. 
d)When I increase it, it seems to decrease the time for hill climbing with minimal affect to SA. 
e)It controls values like temperature,
